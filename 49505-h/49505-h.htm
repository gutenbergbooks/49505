<p class="center xxlargefont">The Romance of the Microscope</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE EARLY DAYS OF THE MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It is certain that lenses were used as early as the
thirteenth century, and it is probable that they
date back to far earlier times. The ancient gem
cutters probably used spheres of glass filled with water
as magnifiers, their work could hardly have been accomplished
without some artificial aid. We know,
from early writings, that burning glasses were used
by physicians in their work, and Seneca, the author,
who wrote in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 63, says: &#8220;Letters, however small
and dim, are comparatively large and distinct when
seen through a glass globe filled with water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Euclid, whose name at least is familiar to everyone,
was, as shown by his writings, perfectly well
acquainted with the fact that curved mirrors may
be used to magnify objects, and that was so long ago
as the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Convex glasses, used as
spectacles, were first mentioned by Bernard de
Gordon, about 1307, but, as far as we know, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
were never used for the purpose of studying minute
living objects.</p>

<p>To Leonardo da Vinci belongs the honour of
seriously investigating, for the first time, the properties
of concave and convex lenses, and several
alchemists, as the early chemists were called, used
flasks filled with water, concave mirrors or glass
balls to gather together the rays of the sun. &#8220;Long
before the dawn of the seventeenth century, the
principle of the lens was both comprehended and
applied to scientific matters by the Englishmen,
Leonard Digges and his son Thomas, and by the
Italian, Giambattista Porta.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century and the
early part of the seventeenth century, interest in the
minute structure of natural objects appears to have
developed. As early as 1590, Thomas Mouffet used
magnifying glasses in studying small mites, and in
1637 Descartes invented a single lens microscope in
which the rays of light were reflected on to the object
by means of a concave mirror. This method of illumination,
it is interesting to note, is still used in
some forms of pocket magnifiers. Most of the early
discoveries were made with single lenses, for in the
compound microscopes which were first made, it
was only possible to view such a small portion of an
object at one time that the advantage lay with the
less complicated instrument.</p>

<p>The earliest microscopes were simply short tubes
of any material which would not admit light; at one
end there was a lens, at the other a glass plate on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
which the object to be examined was placed. Because
these crude instruments were chiefly used for
the examination of insects they were known as
&#8220;Vitrea pulicaria&#8221; or &#8220;Vitrea muscaria.&#8221; Later
they were called &#8220;Engyoscopes,&#8221; and, after the
invention of compound microscopes, they were described
as &#8220;Microscopia ludicra,&#8221; as opposed to the
latter instruments, known as &#8220;Microscopia seria.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next stage in the development of the microscope
consisted in the introduction of lenses of very
short focal length, and, in 1665, Robert Hooke used
small glass balls, formed by fusing threads of drawn
glass, for this purpose.</p>

<p>It was <span id="Leeuwenhoek">Antony van Leeuwenhoek</span>, however, who
perfected these instruments. He brought an extraordinary
skill and industry to bear on the grinding
and polishing of minute lenses of short focal length.
Already in 1673 Regnier de Graaf wrote to the Royal
Society in London that Leeuwenhoek was making
glasses far superior to those of the great Italian
lens maker, Eustachio Divini. Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s success
was largely due not only to his method of
grinding, but also to the skill with which he mounted
his lenses, which were accurately fitted into a
minute hole in a metal plate. The object to be
examined was firmly held in a stand and adjusted
by means of a screw movement. By this means,
and by the use of hollow metal reflectors, he succeeded
in availing himself of transmitted light in
the case of transparent objects. Leeuwenhoek was
able to make immense advances with these instruments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the minute pond animals he could see with
ease, and by 1683 he had even attained a sight of
the bacteria. His researches represented the high-water
mark of work done with the simple microscope,
most of the later work was carried out with
the compound instrument.</p>

<p>The earliest history of the compound microscope
is difficult to separate from that of the telescope
and, in any complete account, the two instruments
must be considered together. It appears that the
first scientist that conceived the idea of using a
series of lenses, rather than a single lens, was
Leonard Digges, whom we have already mentioned.</p>

<p>In a book by Porta, a writer who though not
himself original, was gifted with great curiosity and
industry in the collection of the ideas of others,
we read: &#8220;How to make plain a letter held far
away by means of a lens of crystal,&#8221; and also that
&#8220;with a concave lens you see things afar smaller
but plainer, with a convex lens you see them larger
but less distinct. If, however, you know how to
combine the two sorts properly you will see near
and far both large and clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of Porta&#8217;s book the
method of combining two lenses into a microscope
or telescope was discovered, quite accidentally, by
a Dutch boy named Zacharias, who worked in the
shop of his father, a spectacle maker. The event
was described by Willem Boreel, Dutch Ambassador
to France, in a letter written in 1655. He wrote:
&#8220;I am a native of Middleburg, the capital of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Zeeland, and close to the house where I was born,
there lived in the year 1591 a certain spectacle
maker, Hans by name. His wife, Maria, had a son,
Zacharias, whom I knew very well, because I constantly
as a neighbour and from a tender age went
in and out playing with him. This Hans or
Johannes with his son Zacharias, as I have often
heard, were the first to invent microscopes, which
they presented to Prince Maurice, the governor and
supreme commander of the United Dutch forces, and
were rewarded with some honorarium. Similarly
they afterwards offered a microscope to the Austrian
Archduke Albert, supreme governor of Holland.
When I was Ambassador to England in the year
1619, the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel of Alkomar,
a man familiar with many secrets of nature, who
was serving there as a mathematician to King James,
and was well known to me, showed me that very
instrument which the Archduke had presented as
a gift to Drebbel, namely, the microscope of Zacharias
himself. Nor was it (as they are most seen)
with a short tube, but nearly two and a half feet
long, and the tube was of gilded brass two fingers&#8217;
breadth in diameter, and supported on three dolphins
formed also of brass. At its base was an
ebony disc, containing shreds or some minute objects
which we inspected from above, and their forms were
so magnified as to seem almost miraculous.&#8221; So
this was the first compound microscope!</p>

<p>Although Zacharias invented the microscope, it
was Galileo who introduced it to the scientific world.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
He published a book in 1610 in which he wrote:
&#8220;About ten months ago a rumour reached me of
an ocular instrument made by a certain Dutchman,
by means of which an object could be made to
appear distinct and near to an eye that looked
through it, although it was really far away. And
so I considered the desirability of investigating the
method, and reflected on the means by which I
might come to the invention of a similar instrument.
I first prepared a leather tube at the ends of which
one placed two lenses each of them flat on one side,
and as to the other side I fashioned one concave
and the other convex. Then holding the eye to
the concave one, I saw the objects fairly large and
nearer, for they appeared three times nearer and
nine times larger than when they were observed
by the naked eye. Soon after I made another more
exactly, representing objects more than sixty times
larger. At length, sparing no labour and no expense,
I got to the point that I could construct an
excellent instrument so that things seen through
it appeared a thousand times greater and more than
thirty-fold nearer than if observed by the naked
eye.&#8221; Galileo had his enemies, who accused him
of having picked Zacharias&#8217;s brains; he admitted
that he had taken his idea from the Dutchman&#8217;s
invention, but further than that he would not go;
in fact, he replied that the invention of Zacharias
was a mere accident but that his own instrument
was discovered by a process of reasoning.</p>

<p>It would serve no good purpose to tell the story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of all the scientists who have helped to bring the
microscope to its present state of perfection, although
many of their descriptions of objects and
apparatus are as quaint as the latter. Scheiner,
for example, who wrote in 1630, mentions &#8220;that
wonderful instrument the microscope, by means of
which a fly is magnified into an elephant, and a flea
into a camel.&#8221; To <span id="Kircher">Kircher</span> belongs the credit of
being the first worker to construct an instrument
with coarse and fine adjustment and with a substage
condenser, which could be used either for concentrating
the sun&#8217;s rays or those from a lamp. With
an instrument of this pattern Malpighi saw the
circulation of blood in a frog&#8217;s lung. By 1685, when
instruments with four and six lenses were being
used, the compound microscope was firmly established
as a help to scientists, and the simple lens
was used thereafter as an adjunct but not a rival
to the newer instrument.</p>

<p>History makes a strong appeal to many people,
and those who are fascinated thereby will find
endless amusement in reading old books on the
microscope and its objects. In the preface to
Mouffet&#8217;s <cite>Insectorum Theatrum</cite>, one of the earliest
books on insects, we read the following quaint
lines: &#8220;If you will take lenticular object glasses of
Crystal (for though you have Lynx his eyes, they
are necessary in searching for atoms) you will admire
to see the Fleas that are curasheers, and their
hollow trunk to torture men, which is a bitter plague
to maids, you shall see the eyes of Lice sticking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
forth, and their horns, their bodies crammed all
over, their whole substance diaphanous, and through
that, the motion of their heart and blood. Also
little Handworms, which are indivisible, they are
so small, being with a needle prickt forth from their
trenches near the pool of water which they have
made in the skin, and being laid upon one&#8217;s nail,
will discover by the sunlight their red heads and
feet they creep withal.&#8221; The creatures called Handworms
are itch mites, which tunnel in the human
skin.</p>

<p>In our chapter on Nature Study and the Microscope
we refer to the brown patches to be found on
the backs of fern fronds; it is interesting to note
that so long ago as 1646 Sir Thomas Browne had
quite a good idea of their structure. Describing
them, he said: &#8220;Whether these little dusty particles,
upon the lower side of the leaves be seeds
we have not yet been able to determine by any
germination. But, by the help of magnifying
glasses we find these dusty atoms to be round at
first and fully representing seeds out of which at
last proceed little mites, almost invisible, so that
such as are old stand open, as being emptied of some
bodies firstly included, which though discernible in
Hartstongue, is more notoriously discoverable, in
some differences, of Brake or Fern.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two years earlier a noted scientist, Hodierna,
had made a special study of the eyes of insects and,
considering the crude instruments with which he
must have worked, his descriptions are wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
accurate. Of the house fly he wrote: &#8220;The head
is all eyes, prominent and without lids, lashes or
brows. It is plumed with hairs like that of an
ostrich and has two little pear shaped bodies hanging
from the middle of the forehead. The proboscis
which arises from the snout can be extended freely
and stretched forth to suck up humours and can
afterwards be directed back through the mouth and
taken into the gullet. This instinct nature has
given the creature according to its need, for it is
without a neck and cannot stretch forth its head to
obtain its food, as is also the case with the elephant.&#8221;
The author&#8217;s knowledge of the house fly was evidently
greater than his knowledge of the ostrich,
for the bird has anything but a plumed head. The
eye of the insect he compares to a white mulberry.</p>

<p>Another of these early workers, writing about the
same time, gives a concise account of cheese mites,
heading his description &#8220;On the creatures which
arise in powdery cheese,&#8221; he wrote: &#8220;The powder
examined by means of this instrument (the Compound
Microscope) does not present the aspect of
dirt, but teems with animalcula. It can be seen
that these creatures have claws and talons and are
furnished with eyes. The whole surface of their
body is beautifully and distinctly coloured in such
sort as I have never seen before, and which indeed,
cannot be seen without wonder. They may be
observed to crawl, eat and work and are equal in
apparent size to a man&#8217;s nail. Their backs are all
spiny and pricked out with various starlike markings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and surrounded by a rampart of hairs, all of such
marvellous kind that you would say they are a
work of art rather than of nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>At about this period the microscope was used for
the first time for medical work and, as far as can
be ascertained, Pierre Borel was the first to use it
for this purpose, and he learned a great deal about
the structure of flesh and the appearance of blood.</p>

<p>Of all the early writers on microscopy the man
who spread abroad his knowledge of the instrument
and its capabilities, more than anyone else, was
Kircher, who died in 1680. He was an energetic
writer, and wrote on a large number of subjects.
His books dealt with magnetism, designs for a calculating
machine, light, sound, history of plague,
the philosopher&#8217;s stone, Egyptian antiquities, a
history of China and a grammar. To all who read
his book on the plague, it is clear that he had a
good idea of infection; he was, in fact, the first
writer who suspected it, though the microscope he
used could not show him bacteria. In his book he
wrote: &#8220;Everyone knows that decomposing bodies
breed worms, but only since the wonderful discovery
of the microscope has it been known that every
putrid body swarms with innumerable vermicules,
a statement which I should not have believed had
I not tested its truth by experiments during many
years.&#8221; The experiments he performed to prove
his statement are so quaint that we give them in
his own words.</p>

<p><em>Experiment I.</em>&mdash;&#8220;Take a piece of meat which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
have exposed by night until the following dawn to
the lunar moisture. Then examine it carefully with
the smicroscope and you will find the contracted
putridity to have been altered by the moon into
innumerable wormlets of diverse size, which, however,
would escape the sharpness of vision without
a good smicroscope. The same is true of cheese,
milk, vinegar and similar bodies of a putrifiable
nature. The smicroscope, however, must be no
ordinary one, but constructed with no less skill than
diligence, as is mine which represents objects one
thousand times greater than their true size.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Experiment II.</em>&mdash;&#8220;If you cut up a snake into
small parts and macerate with rain water, and then
expose it for several days to the sun and again
bury it under the earth for a whole day and night
and lastly examine the parts, separated and softened
by putridity, by means of a smicroscope you will
find the whole mass swarm with innumerable little
multiplying serpents so that even the sharpest eyes
cannot count them.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Experiment III.</em>&mdash;&#8220;Many authors claim that unwashed
sage is injurious, but I have discovered the
cause of this. For when, by means of the sun, I
minutely examined the nature of the plant, I found
the back of the leaves completely covered by raised
work as with the figure of a spider&#8217;s web, and within
the water appeared infinitesimal animalcules, which
moving constantly came out of little buds or eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Experiment IV.</em>&mdash;&#8220;If you examine a particle of
rotten wood under the sun, you will see an immense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
progeny of tiny worms, some with horns, some with
wings, others with many feet. They have little
black dots of eyes. What must their little livers
and stomachs be like?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the light of modern discovery much of the
writing of these early microscopists seems absurd.
Kircher&#8217;s experiments, for example, prove nothing,
and he is often hopelessly vague and sometimes incorrect
in his statements. We must not be too
critical, however, for some of this early work was
excellent, the microscopes in use would not be
tolerated at the present day, and without these
pioneers microscopy would not have reached the
stage it has. Rather than laugh at their efforts, we
should marvel that they did so well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smallfont">SOME EARLY MICROSCOPISTS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Of the early British microscopists, Robert
Hooke must not pass unnoticed. He was
appointed Curator of the Royal Society
two years after its formation, and the terms
of his appointment were somewhat one-sided. He
was required to &#8220;furnish the Society every day
they meet with three or four experiments&#8221;; for
this no pay was to be his till the Society accumulated
sufficient funds to reward him.</p>

<p>Although compound microscopes had been invented
in Hooke&#8217;s day, it is noteworthy that he
remained faithful to the single lens, in fact it was
not till very many years later that the simple
lens was supplanted, in general use by the more
complicated, if more perfect instrument.</p>

<p>In his book on Microscopy, entitled <cite>Micrographia</cite>,
Hooke gives a quaint account of the making of a
microscope. &#8220;Could we make a microscope,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;to have only one refraction, it would
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, far excel any other that had a
greater number. And hence it is, that if you take
a very clear piece of a broken Venice glass, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a Lamp draw it out into very small hairs or threads,
then holding the ends of these threads in the flame,
till they melt and run into a small round Globul,
or drop, which will hang at the end of the thread;
and if further you stick several of these upon the
end of a stick with a little sealing wax, so that the
threads stand upwards, and then on a whetstone
first grind off a good part of them, and afterward
on a smooth Metal plate, with a little Tripoly, rub
them till they come to be very smooth; if one of
these be fixt with a little soft wax against a small
needle hole, prick&#8217;d through a thin Plate of Brass,
Lead, Pewter, or any other Metal, and an Object,
plac&#8217;d very near, be look&#8217;d at through it, it will both
magnifie and make some Objects more distinct than
any of the great Microscopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This early worker was noted for the variety of his
investigations rather than for the depths of his
learning. Amongst the so-called Observations, in
his book are many that are not connected with
microscopic work. The following are interesting
and, in the curious old book <cite>Micrographia</cite>, there are
an extraordinary number of well executed illustrations.
Early in his book Hooke compares various
man-made objects, such as a razor edge, the point
of a needle and a piece of cloth, with various natural
objects, and always to the detriment of the former.
He examined <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foraminifera</i> with his microscope, and
was probably the first man to draw these beautiful
little creatures. Petrified wood and charcoal also
came under his notice. When he studied cork, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
observed that it was made up of &#8220;little boxes or
cells,&#8221; and the name cell has survived to this day
despite the fact that it is by no means an appropriate
term. That Hooke&#8217;s knowledge was not very
deep is shown by the fact that he presumed cork
to be a fungus growing on the bark of trees.</p>

<p>Many of the objects we have described in our
pages were described and illustrated by Hooke more
than two hundred years ago. The sea mat, despite
his accurate observations, he mistook for a seaweed,
as many later naturalists have done. The stinging
hairs of nettle he made out in every detail. Fish
scales, bee stings and birds&#8217; feathers all came under
his notice. The foot of a fly he described with
wonderful accuracy; the scales of a butterfly&#8217;s wing
and the head of a fly were all studied and described
in detail. On the life history of the gnat he made
many blunders, but he saved his reputation by remarkable
observations upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chelifer</i>, a curious
parasite of the fly which we mention in our pages,
and upon the silver fish, a little creature which
frequents sugar and starch. Neither of these organisms
had been described before. Fleas, lice, vinegar-eels
and spiders were also studied by this indefatigable
worker, a worthy collection indeed, but Hooke,
like others of his time, was an observer first and
foremost. As a methodical, scientific worker he was
of little account.</p>

<p>Living about the same time as Hooke, the
celebrated Italian, Malpighi, laid the foundations of
much of our present-day knowledge of plant structure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Various romantic stories have been told concerning
certain imaginary events which led Malpighi
to take up the study of plant structure, but the
scientist himself refuted these picturesque stories.
Suffice it to say that his book on the subject,
<cite>Anatome Plantarum</cite>, though imperfect in many
respects and, as might be conjectured in so early a
work, often inaccurate, contains a large number of
astonishingly good drawings; many of the original
drawings, by the way, executed in red chalk, are
in the possession of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that this botanist compared
the falling of leaves to the shedding of an
insect&#8217;s skin, in this respect at any rate he had
advanced no further than Aristotle, who compared
leaf-fall to the moulting of a bird. On the other
hand, the Italian was the first scientist to describe
the pores (stomata) of leaves, though he never discovered
that they occurred on all leaves. He, first
of all men, showed that nectar was formed by the
flower and not transferred thence from other sources
as had previously been believed; he too explained
accurately for the first time the process of germination
in the seed. It was not alone as a botanist,
however, that Malpighi was celebrated. He elucidated
the various changes which take place during
the hatching of an egg; he was the first man to give
an accurate account of the structure of an insect,
and this he did in his work on the Anatomy of the
Silkworm. Using a simple microscope for his investigations,
he contracted an eye affliction during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this period from which he suffered more or less
severely all the rest of his life. He discovered the
breathing tubes of insects and that when they are
covered with grease the insect will die &#8220;in the time
that one can say the Lord&#8217;s Prayer&#8221;; the heart,
the silk glands, the development of wings and legs
were all discovered for the first time by this untiring
worker, aided by his simple microscope.</p>

<p>Pages could be filled with accounts of Malpighi&#8217;s
other scientific work on the structure of the lung,
the liver and kidney, the life of the liver fluke and
a hundred and one other subjects. Though undoubtedly
a great and clever microscopist, the
general estimate seems to be that his work had
little influence upon the scientific world. The main
reason is that he was ahead of his time; men of
the day concluded, for instance, that in his Anatomy
of Plants he had said the last word on the subject,
that there was no more to be learned. An English
worker, Nehemiah Grew, carried the Italian scientist&#8217;s
studies of plant structure a little further and
his Anatomy of Plants contains many new and often
accurate observations. His studies also led him to
discover the structure of the ridges and sweat pores
of the human hand, in fact Grew may be looked
upon as the originator of the study of finger prints.</p>

<p>A Dutchman, Jan Jacobz Swammerdam by name,
and a contemporary of Grew, was undoubtedly the
most accurate observer amongst these old-time
microscopists. Despite ill health, his enthusiasm
was unbounded, and a friend wrote concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
him: &#8220;Swammerdam&#8217;s labours were superhuman.
Through the day he observed incessantly, and at
night described and drew what he had seen. By
six o&#8217;clock in the morning in summer he began to
find enough light to enable him to trace the minuti&aelig;
of natural objects. He was hard at work till noon,
in full sunlight, and bareheaded, so as not to
obstruct the light, and his head steamed with profuse
sweat. His eyes, by reason of the blaze of light,
became so weakened that he could not observe
minute objects in the afternoon, for his eyes were
weary.&#8221; If only for the fact that the Dutchman
made clear the processes involved in the transformations
of insects, his name would be famous. He
described the structure and habits of the hive bees,
male, female and drone with wonderful accuracy,
and illustrated his work with plates which &#8220;would
do credit to the most skilful anatomists of any age.&#8221;
Swammerdam was sarcastic at times; he had shown
that the facets of a bee&#8217;s eye are six-sided and, as
so commonly happened in those days, some naturalists
jumped to a conclusion, in this case that the
fact explained the six-sidedness of the cells in the
honey comb. By the same reasoning Swammerdam
remarked that men, having round pupils, should
build round houses. It is not only for his study of
the minute structure of insects that this microscopist
is noted, he worked upon the tadpole and the snail.
He it was who discovered the red blood corpuscles
of the frog, and he described his discovery in the
following terms: &#8220;In the blood I perceived the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
serum in which floated an immense number of
rounded particles, possessing the shape of, as it
were, a flat oval, but nevertheless wholly regular.
These particles seemed, however, to contain within
themselves the humour<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of other particles. When
they were looked at sideways, they resembled transparent
rods, as it were, and many other figures,
according, no doubt, to the different ways in which
they were rolled about in the serum of the blood.
I remarked besides that the colour of the objects
was the paler the more highly they were magnified
by means of the microscope.&#8221; Of the snail he made
a number of strikingly accurate studies, in all of
which he was aided by his lenses, so that it is the
more remarkable that he considered snails to be
insects.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoek, another Dutchman, <a href="#Leeuwenhoek">we have already
mentioned in our previous chapter</a>. He of
all men brought the simple microscope to its highest
state of development. His instruments were one
of the sights of Holland, and many eminent personages
made a point of seeing them. Though he
had not the advantage of any scientific training and
spoke no other language than his own, he made some
remarkable additions to the scientific knowledge of
the time. Like Hooke, he was not a methodical
worker, he was impelled by an unbounded curiosity.
&#8220;When we are inclined to disparage Leeuwenhoek&#8217;s
hasty methods it is well to recollect that he initiated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
biological inquiries of the greatest interest, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i>, the
parthenogenesis of aphids and the revivification of
dried microscopic organisms, while he gave the first
notices, or the first worth mention, of rotifers,
Hydra, infusorians, yeast cells and bacteria.&#8221;</p>

<p>We may here explain the meaning of the term
&#8220;parthenogenesis of aphids.&#8221; The female aphids
or green flies are able to bring forth generation
after generation during the first two-thirds or so
of each year without the assistance of males. This
form of increase, which by the way accounts for the
extraordinary numbers of green fly, is known as
parthenogenesis.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoek thought that no one but himself
could use his lenses properly, in consequence, when
he sent any interesting object to a friend for him to
examine, a lens was always affixed in place so that
the object could be seen to the best advantage.
He gave a set of his lenses and objects to the Royal
Society, and described his gift as &#8220;a small black
cabinet, lackered and gilded, which has five little
drawers in it, wherein are contained thirteen long
and square tin boxes, covered with black leather.
In each of these boxes are two ground microscopes,
in all six and twenty; which I did grind myself,
and set in silver; and most of the silver was what
I had extracted from minerals, and separated from
the gold that was mixed with it; and an account
of each glass goes along with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kircher, <a href="#Kircher">whose work we mentioned in our last
chapter</a>, was overwhelmed with the notion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
various living creatures are generated from non-living
matter. Fleas, for example, he was certain,
came from dirt, and it remained for Leeuwenhoek
to prove that they arise from eggs and grubs, in
the manner now so well understood.</p>

<p>He carefully studied the structure of a garden
spider, and for the first time explained its wonderful
feet, its jaws and poison gland, its spinnerets and
silk. He studied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i> first of all men, and said
that, under the microscope, its tentacles appeared
to be several fathoms long. Although sadly at sea
over the correct position of his snails in the animal
world, he was clever enough to include <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i>
amongst the plants and fortunate enough to see the
young forms escape from the parent colony.</p>

<p>Concerning this microscopist&#8217;s early studies in
bacteriology we may quote from Professor Miall&#8217;s
<cite>The Early Naturalists</cite>, a book by the way of the
greatest interest to those who would learn something
of the struggles of the men who laid the
foundations of our present-day biological knowledge.</p>

<p>Professor Miall says: &#8220;In 1683 Leeuwenhoek
wrote a letter to the Royal Society which contains
the first mention of bacteria. He had been writing
and speculating upon saliva, and had searched the
saliva of the human mouth for animalcules without
finding any. It then occurred to him to ask whether
the teeth might lodge animalcules discharged from
the salivary ducts. He tells us that, though his own
teeth were scrupulously clean and particularly sound
for his age (about fifty), the lens revealed a white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
deposit upon them. This deposit was found to
contain minute rods, some of which showed either
a steady or gyratory movement. Others were very
minute, of rounded form, and moved with remarkable
velocity. The largest of all, which were either
straight or bent were motionless. The teeth of an
old man, which were never cleansed, contained
among others large rods which exhibited snake-like
undulations. Rubbing the teeth with strong vinegar
did not kill the moving bodies, but they became
quiescent when detached and placed in a mixture
of vinegar and saliva, or vinegar and water. Nine
years later Leeuwenhoek returned to the subject.
Living particles were no longer met with in his
teeth, and he was at a loss to explain why, until
it occurred to him that he was accustomed to drink
hot coffee every morning. This, he thought might
have killed the animalcules, and his conclusion was
confirmed by finding that on the back teeth, which
were less exposed to the hot drink, plenty of them
were still to be found. In 1697 he tells how he
pulled out a decayed tooth, and found that the
cavity abounded in moving particles.&#8221; Nearly a
hundred years elapsed before anyone else took up
the study of bacteria.</p>

<p>From the time of Leeuwenhoek onwards, scientific
discoveries were announced in rapid succession, so
that in one short chapter it is impossible to keep
pace with the progress that was made. Among the
great men who owe much of their success to the
microscope we may mention the Frenchman R&eacute;aumur,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
whose memory is kept green for all time by his
thermometer; as a worker upon problems of insect
life he was indefatigable; the Swede, Linn&aelig;us, to
whose early efforts we owe the orderly arrangement
of living creatures and plants, known as classification.
This arrangement has been considerably
modified, more modern ideas have upset much that
he initiated, yet he remains the parent of orderly
arrangement.</p>

<p>Buffon, a great naturalist, was followed by Cuvier,
the first serious student of fossils; by Humboldt,
naturalist and traveller; by Robert Brown, the
founder of modern Botany; by Darwin and by
Pasteur in turn. How much these men owe to the
microscope can never be known; certain it is that
without its assistance our world, the world we know
and can see, would have been smaller than it is
to-day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE ACTION OF LIGHT</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It is hardly necessary to remark that the
wonderful properties of the microscope depend
upon light. Without light, lenses would
be useless, objects could not be illuminated and
we could not see them. In this short chapter
we propose to give a brief outline of the action
of light; if our words appear to savour of the
school-book, we shall try to avoid it, but, we
repeat, if they do so we would remind our readers
that the more one knows of the action of light the
better use one can make of one&#8217;s instrument. As
a well-known microscopist has remarked we may be
able to afford a costly harp or a costly microscope,
but although we may be able to strike a few notes
on the former and examine a few objects with the
latter, we can only make the best use of either by
thoroughly understanding and practising upon it.</p>

<p>The first thing we learn when we study light is
that it travels in straight lines. The chief source of
light to the inhabitants of this earth is the sun.
Now the sun is so far away that, for all practical
purposes, the rays of light coming from it may be
looked upon as being parallel to one another. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
we must always remember, when dealing with the
sun, though, of course, it does not apply when we
are dealing with lights near at hand, unless they
are specially constructed to throw parallel beams
or rays, whichever we elect to call them. To prove
that light travels in straight lines is not difficult,
and we may devise a number of experiments for the
purpose. The doors and ventilators of many dark
rooms, in which photographic operations are carried
on, are constructed on the assumption that light
cannot travel round corners. An arrangement as
shown in the diagram will allow air, but no light,
to pass. If light were capable of going round
corners, some other arrangement would have to be
devised for the ventilation of dark rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="600" height="239" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Having learned so much about light, we come to
the most important fact of all, as far as the action
of light concerns microscopic work. When rays of
light travel, from a substance like air into a substance
like water, they are bent out of their straight
course. Without any desire to introduce a number
of unfamiliar words, we may venture to remark
that, any substance through which light passes is
called a medium. Some media are clearly more
dense, more compact or solid&mdash;dense is the proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
word&mdash;than others. Water is more dense than air
and glass than either. The bending of light rays is
known as refraction. So now we may state our
second law a little more concisely, thus:&mdash;When
light passes from a medium into one more dense,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>, it is refracted, and the more dense
the medium into which or from which the light
passes the greater the refraction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="600" height="571" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A diagram and an experiment should make
matters clear. Suppose AB is a ray of light traveling
in air and that it falls on a sheet of water,
WXYZ, the ray will be bent along BC and its course
from air to water may be represented by ABC.
Suppose again, WXYZ represents, not water but
glass; as glass is more dense than water the course
of the ray AB is represented by ABD, it is refracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
or bent to a greater extent than the ray which passed
from air into water.</p>

<p>For our experiment we need only plunge a stick
into water and notice that, owing to this property
of light, the stick appears bent, from the point where
it comes into contact with the surface of the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="600" height="249" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Some of us may be old enough to remember that
once, on either corner of nearly every mantlepiece,
there stood an ornament of doubtful utility from
which there hung a dozen or more glass prisms.
Now the only beauty about these otherwise hideous
contraptions was to be seen when light played upon
them. Then patches of violet, green, yellow and
red were thrown upon neighbouring objects. White
light, ordinary sunlight that is to say, is really composed
of various colours&mdash;violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange and red&mdash;which, when combined
together, make light as we know it. When white
light passes through a prism of glass, it is not only
bent out of its course, but broken up into all these
colours. A prism, as we all know, when examined
at either end, is seen to be triangular in shape. Putting
aside for a moment the question of the breaking
up of light into its component parts, the path of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a ray of light through a prism is shown in the
diagram. As the ray passes from air into glass it
is bent, because glass is more dense than air; it
is bent once more on leaving the prism because air
is less dense than glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now lenses are made of various shapes, and those
with two outwardly curved surfaces are known as
double convex lenses. A double convex lens is
usually made with both its surfaces equally curved
and in the finer optical work great care is taken to
ensure that this is the case. For certain purposes,
however, as we shall learn in a moment, one or
other of the faces only may be much more curved
than its companion and this may be carried to such
an extreme that one face is flat, the lens is then
known as plano-convex. Lenses may also have
inwardly curved faces, if both are of this design
they are called double concave; if one face is flat
and the other inwardly curved they are known as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
plano-concave. There are other combinations, for
example, one face may be inwardly curved and the
other outwardly curved, but the four kinds we have
described are all that need trouble us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="600" height="384" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It does not require a great amount of imagination
to recognise that the double convex lens, that
is the lens with two outwardly curved faces is little
more than a pair of prisms placed base to base, or
more accurately, a number of prisms so arranged
as shown in the diagram. Parallel rays of light
falling upon such an arrangement of prisms would
be bent from their course, as shown by the arrows,
and this is just what happens with a double convex
lens. Now rays of light from an object, passing
through a lens of this shape may follow any one of
three courses, according to the position of the object
with regard to the lens. In one position and one
only the rays after passing through the lens will be
parallel to one another, as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>The only position of the object for the above to
take place is when it coincides with a point known
as the principal focus of the lens, conversely the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
parallel rays of light from the sun, after passing
through a double convex lens, will come to a point
at its principal focus.</p>

<p>Suppose now that the object be placed at a point
beyond the principal focus of the lens, the light
rays therefrom will, after passing through the lens,
converge to a point thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_046a.jpg" width="600" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the diagram O is the object and P the principal
focus of the lens.</p>

<p>The third case occurs where the object is nearer
to the lens than its principal focus, then the rays
after passing through the lens, diverge and never
meet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_046b.jpg" width="600" height="344" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We have already stated that when white light
passes through a prism it is broken up into different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
coloured rays varying from violet to red. The
reason for this is that all the light rays composing
white light are not bent equally as they pass from
one medium to another. The violet rays are bent
the most, the indigo next, blue next, down to red,
which is least bent. Once more, considering the
double convex lens as made up of a number of
prisms, let us represent, by a diagram, the course
of parallel rays of white light through it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="600" height="230" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A A&#8242; represent the parallel rays of white light
falling on the lens, L L&#8242;. The blue rays are bent
more than the red, so the principal focus of the
former is at C and of the latter at D. The consequence
of this difference in bending of the various
coloured light rays would be most serious in microscopic
work were not means devised to overcome
it. Objects for instance at C in our diagram would
appear blue, at D they would appear red, whilst at
E E&#8242; though no single colour would predominate
they would be illumined with many coloured rays,
though less strongly than at C or D.</p>

<p>This chromatic aberration, as it is called, depends
amongst other things on the nature of the glass used
in lens construction. It has been found, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that a combination of flint and of crown glass will
overcome the difficulty. In a later chapter we shall
explain the difference between these two kinds of
glass. In practice, a plano-concave lens of flint
glass is combined with a double convex lens of crown
glass and, if the nature of the glass is satisfactory,
as also the shapes of the lenses, there is full correction
for chromatic aberration, and objects viewed
through such a lens will not appear with coloured
margins.</p>

<p>There is one further trouble likely to occur in
such, or any lens. We write of the rays meeting
at a point. In our diagrams we represent the rays
by straight lines, really they are much more complicated
than they appear in a diagram. It is quite
easy to take a ruler and make our imaginary light
rays meet at a point, as a matter of fact, where
real lenses and real light rays are concerned, it is
very difficult, if not impossible, to make the latter
meet at a single point. One more diagram may
make the matter clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="600" height="213" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Parallel rays A pass through our lens and, as we
know, they should all meet at a point P, the principal
focus of the lens; the majority do so, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
some meet at other points, such as P&#8242;. In consequence
of this it is difficult to obtain a clear image
of an object at P, and the lens is said to suffer from
spherical aberration. The perfect simple lens would
be one fully corrected for chromatic and spherical
aberration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE COMPOUND MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">In our chapters, dealing with, the history of
the Microscope, we attempted to trace the
gradual development of the compound instrument
from the simple lens; we stated that the latter,
in a crude form, had been known and used from very
early times and that the former developed side by
side with the telescope. We have also said a few
words in <a href="#Page_40">Chapter III</a>. concerning light for the reason
that the microscope can be better understood and
used more efficiently when we are acquainted with
the phenomena due to light. The simple lens, sold
under the name of pocket magnifier, in its cheapest
form consists of a double convex lens, that is to say,
a lens with two outwardly curved surfaces. Better
quality pocket magnifiers consist of two or more
lenses, which may be either double convex; plano-convex,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, with one surface perfectly flat and the
other outwardly curved, or they may be constructed
of a combination of double convex and plano-concave
lenses, such as were described on <span id="Page_50a">p.</span> .</p>

<p>The object of both the simple and compound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
microscope is to make objects appear larger than
they do to the naked eye. When we buy our pocket
lens we shall find that these little instruments are
constructed to give different degrees of enlargement,
some make objects appear five times larger than they
do to the naked eye, some ten, some fifteen and
some twenty times larger. Twenty times is about
the limit of magnification for the ordinary pocket
lens. If we are observant we shall notice something
else&mdash;the greater the magnification the nearer we
must hold the lens to our object. Within certain
limits, this is not a very serious matter, but a point
is reached where we must hold our lens so near to
the object that we cannot see it, and that is why
we cannot obtain very great enlargement with a
pocket lens. Despite this fact, as we read in our
<a href="#Page_17">opening chapter</a>, some very wonderful discoveries
have been made with these simple microscopes.</p>

<p>Now we wish to show how a compound microscope
works and, having done so, to explain the uses of
its various parts. We shall consider the lenses of
the instrument to be double convex; we do this for
the sake of simplicity. Even in the cheapest compound
microscopes of to-day simple convex lenses
are never used, for the reason we explained in our
<a href="#Page_40">last chapter</a>. To understand the course of the light
rays passing through our microscope, however, we
may look upon the lenses as being merely double
convex.</p>

<p>Let us try a simple experiment first of all. For
the purpose we require two double convex lenses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one capable of magnifying more than the other, a
sheet of paper and a candle. We must darken the
room in which we make the experiment and, having
lighted the candle, we may proceed to make a compound
microscope, for that is really what we are
about to do. Taking the lens which gives the
greatest magnification, we look through it till we
can see a clearly defined image of the lighted candle,
then we fix the lens at that spot, so that, during
the rest of our experiment, the candle and lens
remain at the same distance from one another. Now
we put the piece of paper as nearly as we can in the
position of our eye, moving it nearer or further from
the lens till we have a perfectly clear image of the
candle thrown upon it. The first thing to strike us
is that the image is upside down; it is known as
a real, inverted image. Real because it can be
thrown upon a screen and inverted&mdash;well because it
is upside down. There are some images, as we shall
learn in a moment, which can be seen but which
cannot be thrown upon a screen: they are called
virtual images.</p>

<p>Having fixed our sheet of paper in position, we
take our second lens, focus it sharply upon the back
of the sheet of paper, being careful to keep the
centres of the two lenses as far as possible in a
straight line with one another. Having obtained
a sharp image we remove the paper and gradually
advance our second lens towards the first. We soon
reach a point where we have a very much larger
image of the candle than the first lens gave us; we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
must fix our second lens at this point for we now
have a compound microscope, a very crude one certainly
and without the trimmings which make the
microscope so useful. Before we proceed to explain
what has happened to the light rays we must take
our paper screen once more and place it as near as
possible to the spot where our eye was situated when
we saw the second image. We shall find that, however
much we may move our screen to or from the
second lens we can never manage to obtain an image
upon it for the reason that this second image is
virtual, but unlike the first image it is not inverted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="600" height="195" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One or two diagrams will help to explain our
experiment and, instead of the lighted candle, we
will suppose that our object is an arrow&mdash;it is easier
to draw and serves just as well. The magnification
of the object by our first lens may be represented
by the diagram below, where AA is the lens, CD
the object and D&#8242;C&#8242; its image.</p>

<p>The arrow C&#8242;D&#8242; shows the point at which we
placed our screen, and as our diagram shows, the
image is magnified and inverted.</p>

<p>Our second lens, we remember, was focussed on
the back of the paper, placed at C&#8242;D&#8242;; for practical
purposes we may ignore the thickness of the paper
and say that it was focussed on the image C&#8242;D&#8242;.
Had we left it at that, the further course of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
rays through the second lens would be represented
by a replica of the diagram we have just given.
But, in our experiment, we moved the second lens
nearer and nearer to C&#8242;D&#8242; till we obtained a clear
much magnified erect image of C&#8242;D&#8242;, let us call this
second image C&#8243;D&#8243;, and represent the course of
the light rays by a diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="600" height="407" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We may well ask, why did the lens AA, our first
lens, form a real image whilst the second lens BB,
which is precisely similar to AA, except that its
magnifying power is not so great, form a virtual
image? The formation of a real or a virtual image
is nothing to do with magnification, so we repeat&mdash;why
do two similar lenses form different kinds of
images? Let us refresh our memories with the
remarks concerning the principal focus of lenses in
the <a href="#Page_40">last chapter</a>, then we may try another experiment.
The principle focus of a double convex lens,
we remember, is the point to which parallel rays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of light converge, after passing through the lens.
If now our object is further away from the lens than
its principal focus, a state of affairs that existed in
the case of our lens AA and the object CD, we
obtain a magnified, real but inverted image; if,
on the other hand, using the same lens if we wish,
the object is nearer to the lens than its principal
focus, we obtain a magnified virtual and erect
image. The form of image then depends on the
relative positions of lens and object and not on the
magnifying powers of the former.</p>

<p>After this digression, we will see what happens
when we combine the diagram showing the real,
inverted image, formed by the lens AA with the
virtual erect image, formed by the lens BB. In
reality we will draw a diagram showing the path of
the light rays through our compound microscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="600" height="217" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We have used the same lettering as in our previous
diagrams and we see that, also as before, a real,
inverted image C&#8242;D&#8242; of the object CD is formed by
the lens AA and a virtual, erect image C&#8243;D&#8243; of
the image C&#8242;D&#8242; is formed by the lens BB, the object
CD being further from the lens AA than its principal
focus and the image C&#8242;D&#8242; being nearer to the
lens BB than its principal focus. One very important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
point we must notice before we leave the
diagram. We have mentioned several times that
the image formed by BB is erect and so it is, but
it is an erect image of an already inverted image,
so that the final image of CD, as seen by the eye E
is inverted. The fact that objects viewed through
the microscope appear upside down is puzzling at
first. To all intents our two double convex lenses
represent a compound microscope; actually, they
should be fixed at either end of a tube, blackened
on the inside. The lens AA, nearest to the object,
would then be known as the objective and the lens
BB nearest to the observer&#8217;s eye would be known
as the ocular or, more commonly the eyepiece. There
are, of course, very many refinements, designed to
make the instrument capable of performing the most
accurate work, and needless to say these simple
lenses would neither give very great magnification
nor any clear images. Let us describe a more refined
compound microscope than the one we constructed
in our darkened room. The optical parts, that is to
say the lenses, are the most important parts of every
microscope, upon their qualities depend the degree
of efficiency of the instrument; the metal portions,
known collectively as the stand, contribute to the
easier, smoother working of the microscope.</p>

<div id="Fig_56" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_056fp.jpg" width="600" height="582" alt="" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Head of a Dog Flea</span></p>

<p class="center">No wonder the flea is an annoying creature. As the plate shows, it is armed with knives, lances
and saws, all designed to injure the skin of its victim.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The stand must claim our attention first. The
base of the instrument, called the foot, is usually
either three-legged or horse-shoe shaped; whatever
its form it should be heavy, for only thus can the
microscope be steady, and steadiness is essential in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
all microscopic work. At the top of the foot there
is a joint, in order that all the other parts of the
stand may be inclined at any angle, from the vertical
to the horizontal. Just above the joint is a bent
arm of brass, to the forward end of which a brass
tube is affixed. This tube is designed to hold the
lenses, the objective at its lower end, the eyepiece
at its upper end. The tube is always blackened
inside; were this not the case, light passing through
the objective would be reflected in all directions
from the sides of the tube and a clear image of the
object could never be obtained. The tubes of microscopes
vary in length according to their country of
origin; English and American tubes are ten inches
long, those of continental make vary from a little
more than six inches to rather more than seven
inches in length.</p>

<p>Affixed to the lower end of the bent arm of brass,
mentioned above, is a flat metal plate, known as
the stage; at its centre, there is a circular hole
through which rays of light pass to illuminate objects
placed upon it. Below the stage, at the edge nearest
to the foot, there is a metal peg, over which fits
a tube to which a mirror is attached by a moveable
joint. The mirror reflects light rays through the
opening in the stage. The tube, holding it, can be
slipped up and down the peg under the stage,
thereby bringing it nearer to or further from the
object and so altering the intensity of the reflected
light, as we shall explain in a moment. Owing to
its moveable joint, it is possible to swing the mirror<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to the right or left, so that the reflected light rays
do not pass directly through the object on the stage,
but strike it on one side or the other, thereby giving
what is known as oblique illumination.</p>

<p>The cheapest forms of compound microscopes
have all the parts we have mentioned, and focussing
is carried out by sliding the tube, with its objective
and eyepiece, up and down within its holder, in
order to bring the objective further from or nearer
to the object.</p>

<p>In more expensive instruments there are further
refinements, in fact, on some of the very costly
present-day instruments, there are so many appendages
and appurtenances that it is doubtful whether
some of them are not more of a hindrance than a
help, at any rate they increase the possibility of
trouble by their liability to get out of order. Such
microscopes are only of use to very expert workers;
there are, however, a good many additional features
to be found on quite moderate-priced instruments,
features which are a great help to the microscopist.</p>

<p>It is obvious that we cannot attain any degree of
accuracy in focussing, especially with high magnifications,
when we must perforce raise or lower the
tube by hand. To obviate this difficulty, most
microscopes are provided with mechanism known
as a coarse adjustment; it consists of milled screws
at either end of a metal rod; in the centre of the
rod there is a little cog-wheel which engages with
a row of notches on the tube. By turning the milled
screws slightly in either direction, we can impart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a considerable upward or downward movement to
the tube carrying the objective and focussing at
once becomes a more simple matter. The coarse
adjustment is only useful for examining objects with
a low magnification; if we use it when objects are
being highly magnified we run the risk of screwing
our objective down upon our object, to the certain
destruction of the latter and the probable injury of
the former. To obviate such a catastrophe, most
of the better class microscopes are also provided
with a fine adjustment. By means of this adjustment,
which externally takes the form of a single
milled screw, a considerable turn of the screw in
either direction only imparts a very slight upward
or downward movement to the microscope tube.
In the best instruments, movements of as little as
one hundredth part of a millimetre may be imparted
to the tube by the fine adjustment and, seeing that
there are about twenty-five and a half millimetres
to the inch, it is obvious that a good fine adjustment
is very delicate and, being so, must be treated with
care. The fine adjustment is used to supplement
coarse adjustment in the final focussing, when using
high magnifications.</p>

<p>A few words may be devoted to the mirror, for
on its intelligent use much depends. Usually we
shall find that it is plano-concave, that is to say,
flat on one side and hollowed out on the other.
The use of the mirror, as we have mentioned already,
is to reflect rays of light through the opening of the
stage on to the object we desire to examine. Both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mirrors will reflect parallel rays of light to a point,
just as a double convex lens will so direct them
from their course that they meet at a point. The
concave mirror gives the more powerful illumination,
because it reflects more light rays than a flat
mirror of the same diameter.</p>

<p>We have mentioned that, to obtain full advantage
from the mirror it should be capable of movement
to and from the stage. When we desire strong
illumination we arrange the mirror so that its reflected
rays meet at a point coinciding with our
object. Should less intense illumination be required,
we slide the mirror nearer to the stage, and of course
nearer to our object, so that the reflected rays meet
at a point above the object.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="600" height="256" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The two diagrams, given below, show the path
of the rays of light, where O is the object, and
a trial with our microscope will soon show which
position gives the more powerful illumination.</p>

<p>For high-power work, such as bacteriology or even
the examination of sections of plants, etc., even the
best concave mirror will not give a sufficiently
powerful illumination; accordingly an instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
known as the condenser, is fixed below the stage, between
the mirror and the object. The condenser,
as its name implies, condenses the rays of light reflected
to it by the mirror. It consists of a series
of lenses so arranged that they will throw a very
powerful cone of light. Provision is made for focussing
the rays from the condenser on to the object.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for special forms of illumination, it is
necessary to cut off some of the rays of light passing
through the condenser. It may be that we desire
to dispense with the outer rays of the cone of light
or, when delicate details are being studied, we may
wish to impede the central rays. In either case
diaphragms, popularly called &#8220;stops&#8221; are used.
Our diagrams show A the outer rays of a cone of
light cut off and B the central rays similarly
treated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="600" height="261" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In old pattern microscopes and in many instruments
not provided with condensers, the diaphragm
used for the purpose of cutting off the outer rays
of the cone of light, consists of a blackened circular
metal plate, perforated with a number of different
sized circular holes. This plate is fixed below the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stage in such a manner that, as it is revolved, holes
of various diameters are brought one by one within
the cone of light. It need hardy be remarked that
the smaller the hole in the diaphragm the more
light is cut off and the less reaches the object. In
more modern instruments and in practically all
which are fitted with a condenser, an Iris diaphragm
is fitted. A diaphragm of this nature consists of
a number of thin, blackened, metal leaves, fastened
to a metal ring in such a manner that, when the
ring is revolved, the leaves close together, making
the opening in the centre smaller and smaller. The
Iris diaphragm has many advantages over the old
perforated metal plate. At will, we can have any
opening from full to the merest pin-point or we can
cut off the light rays altogether, should we wish to
do so; we are not confined to a definite number of
stops. As we cut off these outer rays of light we
shall find that, up to a certain point, though the
illumination becomes less and less the object becomes
more and more clear, or, to use the correct
expression, its definition is improved.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to cut off some of the central
rays of the light cone, either a circle of glass with
an opaque centre is dropped into a metal holder
below the stage, or a circular metal plate, held in
the centre of a metal ring by three arms, is used
in the same manner.</p>

<p>The effect of cutting off the central rays of the
light cone is, of course, to reduce the illumination
and to show up delicate detail to advantage. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
direct rays of light reach the objective, such as do
pass into the microscope are all diffused from the
edges of the object.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that the optical parts
of the compound microscope are of greater importance
than what may be termed the mechanical
portions and the objectives are more important than
the eyepieces. Better results can always be obtained
with a good, high-power objective and a low-power
eyepiece, than with an inferior objective and a good
quality eyepiece. The merits of the eyepiece, however
great, will not be adequate compensation for
the failings of the objective. Modern objectives are
composed of several lenses and of a combination of
flint and crown glass, as we explained in our <a href="#Page_40">last
chapter</a>. They are so designed that they can be
screwed into the lower part of the microscope tube.
The focal length of each objective is, or should be,
marked upon it; as a general rule, however, it may
be taken that the smaller the lower lens, the shorter
its focal length and therefore the greater its magnifying
power.</p>

<p>The form of eyepiece most usually met with is
known as Huyghen&#8217;s. It consists of two plano-convex
lenses, with their flat or plane surfaces directed
away from the objective. The smaller of the two
lenses is situated nearer to the eye of the observer
and is known as the eyeglass; its function is to
magnify the image formed by the objective. The
larger, lower lens is known as the field or collecting
glass; it renders the image clearer though, in so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
doing, it reduces the magnification of the eyeglass.
In instruments provided with more than one eyepiece
we shall wish to know which gives the greater
magnification; this is or should be marked upon the
metal rim surrounding the eyeglass but, in general,
it may be stated that the shorter the eyepiece the
greater its magnification. We repeat again, increase
your magnification always, when possible, by using
higher power objectives rather than eyepieces with
greater magnifying powers. Sometimes it is necessary
to use a greater magnification than our most
powerful objective will give us; then we must fit our
most powerful eyepiece and draw out the upper part
of the microscope tube&mdash;in the best instruments they
are made to pull out, after the manner of the telescope.
The effect of so doing will be to increase
the magnification considerably but, at the same
time, the definition or clearness is seriously impaired.</p>

<p>For the examination of practically all our microscopic
objects we require a number of slides, little
glass slips of good, thin, clear glass. They may be
used over and over again unless we make permanent
preparations, but we are hardly likely to do so in
our early days. The slides are held in place on the
microscope stage, either by a pair of clips attached
thereto or by resting against a bar running across
the stage. We may here remark that it is essential
always to keep one&#8217;s microscope slides absolutely
clean. Dirty slides denote the careless worker;
moreover, dirt when magnified is misleading.
Objects which are being examined in water or any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
other liquid should be covered with a cover-slip,
an exceedingly thin circle or square of glass. The
cover-slip is as much a protection for the objective
as for the object and its cleanliness also, is all
important.</p>

<p>We have not mentioned any refinements such as
the mechanical stage, by means of which slides on
the stage may be rotated, moved to the front and
to the back of the stage or from side to side. We
have omitted these because they are not essential
even for the very best work; they lend additional
comfort to the use of the microscope but, again,
they are not essential. The microscopist who requires
such luxuries may learn about them in the
larger text-books on the microscope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smallfont">ANIMAL LIFE IN THE PONDS AND STREAMS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The enthusiastic microscopist will probably
never lack material for his instrument, whatever
branch of microscopical work he may
decide to make his own. To the student of Pond
Life, either animal or vegetable, there is granted a
never-ending store of beautiful and interesting
objects. Because one pond has been thoroughly
searched and all that it can offer has been carefully
examined, we must not conclude that no other pond
will be worth our attention. Though indeed many
little animals occur over and over again in practically
every pond, there are other equally interesting
animals which only occur in certain localities and for
these we must keep a sharp look-out.</p>

<p>The apparatus needed for the collection of the
denizens of ponds and streams, need consist of no
more than a net with a very fine mesh and a jar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in which to bring our captures home; for, of course,
animals which dwell in water need not be dried on
the journey home. Various useful accessories for
the student of pond life are sold at very reasonable
rates by most scientific instrument makers.</p>

<p>We shall find many representatives of the animal
world in our pond and exceedingly interesting most
of them will prove. From the mud we may obtain
the &#8220;protean animalcule,&#8221; known to scientists as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Am&oelig;ba Proteus</i>, the most lowly of all animals.
Though this creature is plentiful and just visible to
the naked eye, he is not easy to separate from his
surroundings. He is almost colourless and therefore
paler than the mud. Having secured him on the
end of a glass rod, let us examine him in a drop of
water on a slide. At first he will remain motionless,
as a protest against being disturbed; we shall not
have to wait long, however, for soon one part of his
body will be seen to protrude and then grow larger
and larger till it forms a false foot; other parts
may follow suit, till he is more elongate than oval,
and he moves in the direction of his false foot with
a curious gliding motion. His pace is not great and
has been calculated at a twenty-fifth of an inch in
an hour. Really the &#8220;protean animalcule&#8221; is little
more than an animated drop of jelly, a fact we can
substantiate by watching him feed. His food consists
of minute water plants such as diatoms, and
when one of these plants comes within his line of
march he simply surrounds it with his false feet
and, as it were, flows around it. When he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
digested all he can he flows away from the undigested
portions; he has no mouth or any of the
organs usually associated with animal anatomy.</p>

<p>While hunting for our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Am&oelig;ba</i>, it is highly probable
that a very active little slipper-shaped organism
may have forced himself upon our attention. From
his shape he has earned the popular name of the
slipper animalcule. He is rather more highly organised
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Am&oelig;ba</i> for he possesses a mouth, as
we shall see when we are able to examine him. So
rapidly does he swim, however, that something must
be done to curb his activity; he may either be
killed with a drop of weak acid or we may put
a little tuft of cotton wool on our drop of water
and a coverslip lightly over that. The threads of
cotton wool will form a network, in the meshes of
which the active little animalcule will be confined.
Careful observation will show that he is, like a
slipper, more pointed at one end than at the other;
that there is a funnel-shaped orifice, his mouth, at
one side of his body; and that he is covered with
little threads which lash the water with rhythmic
movement and propel him with considerable rapidity.
These little threads also send currents of water
to his mouth, and in the water is his food.</p>

<p>Having examined these two free swimming denizens
of the pond, we may advantageously turn our
attention to some of the weeds growing therein.
Careful examination with our pocket lens will almost
certainly reveal a number of minute living creatures
attached to the submerged stems and leaves. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is impossible to describe all the interesting creatures
we might find: we must content ourselves with two,
because they are common inhabitants of many
ponds. One interesting little creature we are almost
certain to find, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>. He may be green or
he may be brown but in structure he will remind us
of a small sea anemone. When we put him under
the microscope he has the appearance of a mass of
jelly attached to the water plant on which we found
him. He will soon open himself out, however, and
we shall see that his free end is provided with a
number of tentacles; these he waves about in the
water to draw small swimming creatures to his
mouth which is situated in the centre of the group
of tentacles. Any luckless creature, coming within
reach of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>, is at once stung with one of the
barb-shaped stings which stud his tentacles and then
passed to his mouth. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i> is wonderfully
tenacious of life; it is said that he has been turned
inside out, like a glove finger, without suffering any
inconvenience. Probably the specimen we are examining
will have a swelling on the side of its body,
which might be mistaken for the result of some
injury; it is nothing of the kind; it is merely a
bud which will grow into a young <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i> and, when
old enough, become detached from its parent and
float away to another plant. Under a fairly high
magnification, we shall almost certainly see something
gliding rapidly over the body of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>;
its movements are too quick to allow of careful
examination; the creature which is almost as elusive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as the slipper animalcule is a parasite of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>.</p>

<p>Not quite so common as our last object but still
common enough to be mentioned here is the beautiful
&#8220;bell animalcule.&#8221; Like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>, this
creature, except in its very young stages, remains
affixed to a water plant. In shape the &#8220;bell animalcule&#8221;
resembles a wineglass on a long delicate stem;
round the part corresponding to the rim of the glass,
there is a fringe of the hair-like, water-lashing structures
with which so many of these lowly creatures
are provided, and these structures also surround the
entrance to the funnel-shaped mouth. When undisturbed,
the bell animalcule has its slender stalk
fully extended and its little threads lash the water
vigorously, causing currents, containing food material,
to travel towards its mouth. A sharp tap on
the microscope slide will cause the creature to contract,
the threads cease their lashing and the stalk
contracts spirally, so that the body of the animalcule
is drawn close to the object to which it is
attached. By degrees the spiral uncoils and the
little threads resume their lashing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as we examine our bell animalcule,
we may be fortunate enough to see it splitting into
two parts to form two separate individuals. This
curious process should be watched carefully. The
upper part of the bell splits first and, by degrees
the whole bell divides into two equal parts so that
we have a pair of bells on a single stalk. The next
stage consists of the formation of a ring of whip-like
structures round the base of one of the bells;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
both bells, by the way, have the circlet of whips
round their upper edges. Soon after these additional
little whips are formed, the owner of them breaks
away from the stalk and swims about in the water
for a time, finally coming to rest on a suitable water
weed. Then the lower ring of whips has served its
purpose and in its place a long stalk grows; from
this time forward the new bell animalcule will never
move from the position it has chosen. This form of
increase, this simple splitting takes place over and
over again but by degrees the little animal appears
to become exhausted and the process slows down or
stops.</p>

<p>The partially exhausted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vorticella</i> may gain increased
vitality by fusion with another individual
and this process also we may have the luck to see
though it is less frequent than the simple splitting.
Sometimes a bell may be observed to divide, not
into halves, but into two unequal parts. The smaller
of these parts may divide again into from two to
eight parts, each one of which, having developed
a fringe of little whips, swims off on its own account.
These little barrel-shaped swimming forms, instead
of settling down and forming stalked bells, seek an
exhausted creature, fuse with it near the base of its
bell and finally become absorbed by it. The result
of this fusion is that the bell animalcule takes on
a new lease of life and once more begins to divide
actively.</p>

<p>In our search for specimens for our microscope
we may come across a very common pond dweller,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
closely related to the bell animalcule, known by
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carchesium Spectabile</i>. We cannot fail
to recognise its family likeness to the form we have
already studied, for it consists of a large number
of stalked bells growing on a single parent stem.
It is really a little colony of bells. When one of the
young individuals of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carchesium</i> settles down in the
spot it has selected for its dwelling-place, it grows
a stalk just as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vorticella</i> did, and it divides later into
two individuals. Now in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vorticella</i> only the bell
divides, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carchesium</i> part of the stalk divides also
and, instead of swimming away to find a new home
it remains attached to the parent stalk. When this
has happened several times a goodly colony is
formed.</p>

<p>There are few fresh-water animals more commonplace
and apparently uninteresting when observed
casually than the pond sponge and the river sponge.
Yet, if we take either of them home and examine
them with the aid of our microscope, we shall be
delighted with our specimens. In reality they are
of absorbing interest and, at certain times of the
year we may easily obtain young sponges, and
capital objects they make for the microscope.</p>

<p>Before we describe our two specimens let us try
to explain what manner of creature a sponge really
is. If we examine any bath sponge, we notice that
it is perforated with many small holes and some
larger ones. Some sponges show this better than
others. The small holes are pores, the large ones
mouths, but, as we shall see in a moment we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
not run away with the idea that they in any way
resemble our familiar idea of a mouth. These large
holes are called oscula by scientists, but we wish to
avoid scientific words as much as possible. The
simplest sponge of all, consists of a little bag, which
remains affixed by its base to a seaweed. All over
its sides there are many pores and at its tip there
is a single osculum; it is known as the Purse Sponge
and is common round our coasts. The inside of the
purse sponge is lined with cells, each one of which
is tipped with a little whip which waves about unceasingly.
The waving of the whip causes water
to flow through all the pores into the hollow bag
and out again by way of the osculum. Although
most sponges, including our fresh-water forms, are
much more complicated than the purse sponge, the
same thing happens in them all, water is drawn
in by way of the pores and forced out by way of
the oscula.</p>

<p>The best place to seek for the fresh water sponges
is on the under sides of floating wood, broken tree
branches and the like. Their appearance depends
upon whether they have been growing in a well-lighted
spot or in darkness; they contain chlorophyl
as do the higher plants, and sponges grown in the
light are green, those which the light has not reached
are buff-coloured or corn-yellow. The pond sponge
is brighter green than its river frequenting relative
and is a coarser creature altogether. It often forms
little finger-like outgrowths, whereas the river
sponge is more leaflike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>If we examine one of these sponges in a watch
glass of water to which we have added a very little
carmine powder, we can easily see the water currents
entering the pores and coming from the oscula.
Towards autumn, if we open a river sponge we shall
see little yellow bodies about the size of a pin&#8217;s
head; they are the buds from which the young
sponges arise. One of these must be removed very
carefully and placed in a watch glass of water; if
our specimen be placed in the sun, we shall not have
many days to wait before we find that it has given
rise to an active transparent little creature, to a
young sponge in fact. By repeating our experiment
with carmine, by the aid of the microscope, we can
see the water currents passing through its body.</p>

<p>Wherever we collect our pond water we are
certain to find some of the wheel animalcul&aelig; or
rotifers. There are such a number of different kinds
that we might describe several, and yet not mention
the one that any of our readers had happened upon.
They may be recognised, because they are always
so transparent that all their internal organs may be
plainly seen and they always have two or more
discs or lobes, at their forward end, fringed with
fine whip-like threads. These little threads are
constantly in motion, so that they appear like little
revolving wheels hence the name, wheel animalcule.
Nearly all these creatures have a sucker or false foot
at their tail end by means of which they attach
themselves to some support or they may swim
freely in the water. The study of rotifers has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the life-work of some scientists and they will afford
any microscopist, who is interested in them with
abundant occupation.</p>

<p>Amongst the water weeds we shall probably find
another small but striking creature, known as the
sun animalcule, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actinophrys Sol</i>. Why exactly it
is called the sun animalcule we cannot say, probably
it has earned its title from the fact that it resembles
the conventional idea of the sun, with light rays
radiating all round its circumference. The creature
is whitish-grey in colour, spherical in shape and just
visible to the naked eye. All over the surface of
its body there are a number of apparently empty
spaces, known as vacuoles&mdash;they probably account
for its peculiar colour. Everywhere, it is studded
with long, slender-pointed rod-like outgrowths.
But rarely, the sun animalcule exhibits any movement
and for long periods the only signs that it is
living occur at feeding time. Its food consists of
water animals and plants, of varying size. When
a small animal comes into contact with one of the
pointed rods, which radiate from the animalcule,
it appears to be held there in some unaccountable
manner and, after a pause, it begins a fateful journey
by sliding down the rod to the spherical body of its
captor. Then it is passed into one of the vacuoles
and digestion very soon takes place. That it does
not do so immediately is shown by the fact that the
wheels of a wheel animalcule, which has been passed
to the vacuole of our subject, continue their movements
for a considerable period. When larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
animal food is partaken of, a different method is
pursued by the sun animalcule. A water-flea, for
instance, coming into contact with one of the rods
will struggle violently in its efforts to escape. Then
the sun animalcule shows real signs of life, for some
of the other rods bend over and hold the captive
so that it, eventually, is passed to a vacuole.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#Page_178">chapter on agriculture</a> we mention a peculiar
flat worm known as the liver fluke. This unpleasant
creature has one or two relatives who make
their home in ponds and, though they are not
more beautiful than the liver fluke to look upon,
they are quite harmless. One of these flat worms
is about <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span>-inch long and not unlike an indian club
in shape. It moves about, with some speed either
by the aid of a sucker on its head or by a curious
gliding movement. The other pond-frequenting
flatworm is more like the liver fluke, its leaflike oval
body, about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>-inch long, is pointed fore and aft.
It is a common sight to see it gliding here and there
in search of still smaller animals off which it may
make a meal.</p>

<p>The sea mat and bird&#8217;s head, two common animal
colonies of the sea-shore, possess pond-dwelling
relatives of the greatest interest to the microscopist.
Like the seaside forms they dwell in colonies. One
of the commonest is known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lophopus Crystallinus</i>
and it may be found attached to duckweed, the
curious little plant whose tiny leaves float upon the
surface of the water. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lophopus</i>, when at rest, resembles
a little piece of jelly. If we are patient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and watch it under our microscope we shall see it
expand, sending forth a number of stalks, each one
tipped with a horse-shoe shaped feathery tentacle.
Each of these tentacles belongs to a separate animal
which with its fellows forms a colony. Not so
interesting are the branched, threadlike colonies of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plumatella Repens</i> which may be sought upon the
leaves of water plants. Our ponds can furnish no
more extraordinary object for our microscope than
a colony of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cristatella Mucedo</i>; it is curious in appearance
and still more curious from the fact that
though a colony of animals it acts like a single
individual in crawling over the weeds and stones in
shallow, sun-kissed water. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cristatella</i> colony
is jelly-like and greenish in colour, in length it may
grow to a couple of inches. Its under surface is
flat, whilst from its upper, convex surface the little
animals forming the colony wave their brush-like
tentacles in the water.</p>

<p>In searching the various pond weeds for specimens
we are sure to meet with various jelly-like masses;
these must always be examined carefully. They may
be the egg-masses of interesting water creatures;
various water-snails, for instance, protect their eggs
with a jelly-like covering.</p>

<p>If we meet with any large fresh-water mussels,
sometimes called swan mussels, we shall probably
find the fleshy parts of the molluscs swarming with
minute creatures, which we may conclude are parasites.
Mussels, like nearly all living creatures, have
their parasites it is true, but what we have discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will almost certainly prove to be young
mussels. We must examine them under the microscope
to make sure. Then we shall see, if young
mussels they be, very minute and very thin-shelled
little creatures; the edges of their shells are armed
with teeth and are quite unlike the highly polished
and smooth shells of the parent mussel. We shall
also see a long thread issuing from the animal
within the shell. If we are examining the young
mussel in water we shall notice that it is constantly
snapping its two shells together.</p>

<p>Had we left these young mussels undisturbed,
a very curious life they would have led. They
would have remained attached to their parent for
some little time probably, or some of them might
have fallen to the muddy bed of the pond. Their
behaviour in either case would be the same. The
long threads that we have already examined would
have floated in the water and, directly they were
touched by a passing fish, the little shells would
begin to snap violently. The lucky ones would not
snap in vain for they would close upon the fin or
tail of the fish and then their snapping would cease.
Like the bulldog, these little mussels may take a
long time in getting hold but when once they have
managed to fasten their teeth into anything it is
well-nigh impossible to make them let go. Usually
they never let go, but are carried away by the fish.
In most cases, the irritation they set up in the flesh
of their new-found foster parent causes a swelling
to occur with the result that the little mussels are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
engulfed. Within the flesh of the fish they go
through a series of changes; they lose their teeth
and their tell-tale thread, they become in fact miniatures
of the adult mussels, then they manage to
escape from the fish, settle down in the mud and
fend for themselves.</p>

<p>The crabs and lobsters which we know so well
have fresh water relatives in nearly every pond.
Many of the creatures we have examined have
needed careful search to discover their whereabouts;
not so the fresh water crustacea, as they are called.
Their activity, their curious movements in the water
compel attention.</p>

<p>The fresh water shrimp is a curious little creature,
sometimes he paddles his three pairs of hind legs
and sometimes he jerks his body in a ludicrous
manner, in either case he manages to propel himself
rapidly through the water. He is about half an inch
long, brown in colour and with a curved body not
unlike a shrimp. If we examine him under the
microscope we notice that his front legs are bent
forwards, whilst his hind legs are bent backwards.
The male water flea is much larger than the female,
a fact which probably accounts for the fact that
these little animals often carry their wives about
with them by seizing them with their fore legs.</p>

<p>The water louse we may also encounter, he is not
nearly so interesting as the fresh water shrimp. He
is closely related to the wood louse which we all
know, and has a similar flattened body.</p>

<p>Very much smaller though even more interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is the common water flea. By day these animals
retire to the mud at the bottom of the pond but,
morning and evening, they swim actively with a
curious jerky motion. We must examine our specimen
carefully for he is of more than ordinary interest.
We cannot fail to observe how transparent
he is, so much so that all his internal organs can be
plainly seen, but let us deal with his exterior first
of all. His large eyes are plainly visible, but his
most conspicuous feature is the pair of large
branched feelers, by means of which he swims. If
we examine several specimens, one or more is certain
to be a female, then we may probably observe
an egg in process of formation in the brood pouch,
a large, elongated cavity, just below the back of the
animal. Immediately above the brood pouch, the
heart is situated and, if we can induce its owner to
keep still for a moment or two, the heart-beats may
be plainly seen.</p>

<p>Not unlike the water flea as it swims about in
the water of our collecting jar is the curious, transparent
little creature known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypris</i>. Although
so transparent its body is contained in a pair of
shells, very similar to those of the mussel; a fact
which formerly led to its being classed with the
shell-fish. We may well examine this little fellow
under the microscope for much of his structure may
be made out through his shell. His very conspicuous
eye is sure to attract our attention; he possesses
but a single eye and seems to make up for the lack
of a second by having a very large one. Two pairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of feelers project beyond the shell in front. Of his
two pairs of legs the foremost, or at least their tips,
hang down below the shell, but the last pair, as
we can see through the shell, are turned upwards.
At the hinder end of the body, there are two long
bristles, they may best be seen when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypris</i> is
swimming. Of what use exactly these bristles may
be to their owner is not definitely known, but it
is thought that they are of service in keeping his
shell clean.</p>

<p>Another active little animal, quite as common as
the water flea, is sure to attract our attention. It
is no larger than the water flea but much more
elongated; some specimens are bigger than others,
and the bigger ones are the females. Its name is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclops</i> and, though so common, it has no popular
name.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclops</i> is so named on account of the fact that
it possesses but a single eye; it is, however, rather
an interesting creature in other respects, so we will
study it more closely. Looking down upon the
creature, we see that the front part of its body is
composed of an undivided shield, behind which there
are four plates and behind these again there are in
the male five and in the female four segments or
rings, at the extreme tip there is a forked tail, each
fork being furnished with a number of bristles. On
the head are two pairs of organs, one pair long the
other pair short and, if we observe <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclops</i> in the
act of swimming, we shall see that the long pair
of organs play the chief part. In the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
front of the head there is a black or red patch&mdash;the
eye. Very frequently we may meet with a
specimen carrying a relatively large bladder-like
body on each side of its abdomen. These bladders
which are each about one-third as long as the
creature which carries them, are egg-sacs.</p>

<p>If we are able to secure one or two specimens
with egg-sacs attached, we can study the young
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclops</i> without much difficulty. Take a small
glass tube&mdash;a test-tube as used by chemists will
serve admirably&mdash;partly fill it with pond water and
add a little water weed, then introduce the egg-bearing
females and place in the light. We must
watch the tube from day to day, and before long
it will be evident that the young ones have arrived
in the world, for we shall have no difficulty in seeing
dozens of little white specks swimming about in the
water and settling on the sides of the tube. We
must remove one carefully on the end of a glass rod
or on a paint brush and examine it in a drop of
water under the microscope. This young creature
is totally unlike its parent, it is oval and possesses
three pairs of stiff bristles, of which the first pair
are simple and the other two pairs are branched.
Although the bristles are used solely for swimming at
this stage, it may be of interest to mention that in
the adult <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclops</i> they become transformed into
jaws and the two pairs of organs we have already
examined. At the front end of the oval body
we can closely distinguish the single eye, which
persists throughout life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smallfont">PLANT LIFE IN PONDS AND STREAMS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">In this chapter we shall confine ourselves to the
true water-dwelling plants, as distinct from
those, such as the water lilies, which though
never found growing on dry land, appear undecided
whether they will be water plants or land plants.
Looking at the matter from a more scientific point
of view, all our pond plants will be much lower in the
scale of development than the water lilies and other
flowering plants.</p>

<p>Pond life is rich in subjects for the microscopist.
Any stagnant pool may contain organisms which
will delight the naturalist who has always depended
upon his unaided vision. Curiously enough, amongst
the most wonderful of all these pond-dwelling plants
are the Diatoms, which consist of but a single cell.
They are so numerous, they exist in so many different
forms and in so many different situations that were
we able to describe them all, we should require
the whole of a large volume, much larger than this.
In colour, Diatoms are usually brown or brownish,
although they contain chlorophyll, the green colouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
matter of higher plants. In shape they may be
rod-shaped, crescent-shaped, circular, wedge-shaped,
oblong or oval. Some float about freely in the
water, some are attached to supports by means of
stalks. Some lead a solitary life and others dwell
together in colonies. One feature they have in common,
a curious flinty cell wall, and this is their most
interesting point to the microscopist. This natural
armour is in two parts which fit one within the other
like the two halves of a Japanese basket. All manner
of beautiful sculpturing marks these beautiful
frustules as they are called; in some cases they are
perforated and the living matter from within passes
through the pores and forms a jelly-like covering
for the little plant.</p>

<p>We must make a point of collecting all the
Diatoms we can find, for they are always interesting;
moreover, they are easily preserved and made
into permanent slides, for the little plants may be
boiled in acid to destroy their living parts and the
frustules will survive the boiling undamaged.</p>

<p>One might wonder how such humble plants, surrounded
as they are with flinty walls, could increase.
They frequently do so in a simple manner.
The living matter of which the plant is composed
pushes the frustules apart and divides across the
middle. The result of this event is the formation
of two plants, each with a single frustule. In a
very short time each plant grows a new frustule,
but it is always much smaller than the one with
which it started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The movements of some of the free swimming,
that is to say non-attached Diatoms, are worthy of
study. The scientific name of one kind, translated
into everyday language, means little boats, and
indeed they are well named for their beautiful
aquatic man&oelig;uvres rival those of any ship.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar in habit to the brown Diatoms
are the green Desmids, but, whereas, the former also
occur in the sea, the latter are all confined to fresh
water. Sometimes Desmids are so numerous that
they make the pond water as green as green-pea
soup. It would be as impossible to describe all these
plants as was the case with the Diatoms, but generally
they may be recognised by the fact that they
are composed of two similar halves, separated by
more or less of a waist. Although some of the Desmids
exhibit a certain amount of movement they
are not active like the Diatoms.</p>

<p>Late spring and autumn are the best seasons to
hunt the ponds for our next object, which rejoices
in the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydomonas Angulosa</i>, a good example
of the extraordinary fact that some of the
smallest animals and plants have the longest names.
This little plant is interesting in itself and doubly
so, because it was for long thought to be an animal;
it is wonderfully animal-like in its movements.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydomonas</i> is very minute, so we must use
our highest magnification when we examine it. It
is an oval, one-celled plant enclosed in a clear membrane.
The green colouring matter is arranged in
the form of a cup, within the hollow of which is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
mass of granular living substance. At the forward
end of the plant, there is a clear space and near the
tip a brownish dot, known as the eye spot; which,
though incapable of seeing as we understand it, is
sensitive to light, as shown by the fact that the
little plant will swim towards moderately intense
light and away from strong light. If we stain the
plant with iodine we can plainly see a pair of
little whips arising from the clear portion at the
forward end; it is by the lashing of these that the
plant is enabled to swim.</p>

<p>In the mud of our pond we may find a little colony
of plants which might forgivably be mistaken for
a collection of the individuals we have just studied.
Each member of the colony is very much smaller
than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydomonas</i> to be sure, but each one has
the outer membrane, the brownish eye spot and the
pair of little whips. On the other hand the chlorophyll
fills the whole of each cell and is not arranged
in the form of a cup. Sixteen cells form a colony,
and the whole mass is a flat plate; the little whips
move in unison and the whole colony revolves after
the manner of a wheel.</p>

<p>Another little colony we may encounter also,
consists likewise of sixteen cells very like the ones
we have described, but somewhat wedge-shaped
instead of oval. A jelly-like mantle encloses the
colony and, in outline, it is spherical, so that when
the little whips, which project through the mantle,
lash the water the whole colony revolves.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of these colonies of cells is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox Globator</i>, it may be recognised by
its perfectly spherical shape and its characteristic
movements in water. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i> is about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">25</span> inch in
diameter, and although to the uninitiated it appears
to be a single minute plant, in reality it is a colony
of upwards of twenty thousand cells. The colony
may be considered as being made up of thousands
upon thousands of cells, very similar to those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydomonas</i>, and each one arranged with its
pair of little whips directed outwards.</p>

<p>Within the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i> sphere we may observe a
number, usually one to eight, of smaller spheres.
These are so-called daughter colonies which have
arisen from the continued division of special cells.
They develop, fairly rapidly, into young <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i>
colonies, then they burst through the cells of the
parent colony, swim out into the water and quickly
grow to the size of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i> from which they were
formed.</p>

<p>There is another kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i> of a yellowish
colour and much smaller than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Globator</i>, the big one
is the one we must procure; it is much more easily
studied.</p>

<p>Certain of the plants we shall find in our pond
are so animal-like in their movements, that the
microscopist who sees them for the first time may
wonder whether we are not mistaken in calling them
plants. We have already described the common
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlamydomonas</i>, with its curious jerky method of
propelling itself through the water. There is, however,
an equally common one-celled, pond-frequenting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
plant which has puzzled naturalists even more,
for it certainly possesses many very animal-like
characteristics. Its name is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euglena Viridis</i> and we
require our highest magnification to examine it for it
does not exceed one-two hundred and fiftieth
part of an inch in length. Usually, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euglena</i>
is cigar-shaped but, as it possesses the very
unplant-like characteristic of not having a firm cell
wall it can change its shape to a considerable extent
and it often assumes curious forms. At the forward
end of this minute plant there is a single whip-like
thread, by means of which it swims; a little below
the base of the whip, there is a red eye spot. Elsewhere
we have described how the protean animalcule
feeds by flowing round its food-material,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euglena</i> feeds in a similar manner, but it also feeds
after the manner of a plant. When this active little
plant is about to increase it either divides into two
lengthways or becomes surrounded with a firm wall
within which it breaks up into a number of young
forms which are released later by the bursting of
the wall.</p>

</div>

<p>Small wonder that scientists were in doubt concerning
the true nature of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euglena</i>, its non-walled
cell and peculiar mode of feeding are indeed
puzzling. There are many similar cases amongst
these lowly organisms, in fact there are some
creatures which may best be described as partly
plant and partly animal. Those of our readers who
are interested in such problems may read an excellent
account given much more fully than we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
give it here, in Professor F. W. Keeble&#8217;s <cite>Plant
Animals</cite>, one of the excellent Cambridge Manuals
of Science. The fact is that the demarcation between
plants and animals, low in the scale of
development, is not nearly so pronounced as it is
amongst the higher forms of life. Amongst the
plants of our pond we shall find that, like the land
plants, most of them are green, and many of them
are thread-like, so that the task of distinguishing
one from another may appear difficult. Examined
with the naked eye, many of them appear remarkably
similar to one another; under the microscope
the differences are obvious.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of the commoner pond
plants is known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscillatoria</i>; it does not boast
of a popular name but its scientific name is not very
difficult to remember after we have witnessed its
oscillations. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscillatoria</i> is a plant with particularly
animal-like movements. It is merely a thread, usually
green-blue in colour, but sometimes red or violet.
The threads are never branched and, except when
in motion, are straight. Under a moderately high
magnification we can see that this thread-like plant
is not composed of a single cell but that it consists
of a number of cells, placed end to end. Sometimes
a few of these cells will break away and start life
on their own account.</p>

<p>Whatever interest the structure of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscillatoria</i>
may have for us, we cannot help being struck with
its movements, and we must make a point of
observing them. The movement is peculiar and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
easy to describe nor, so far as we know, has it ever
been explained. A thread will be seen to glide backwards
and forwards, becoming somewhat curved
and, at the same time, revolving on its axis. Eel-like
is perhaps a good description of the movement.
It is possible to distinguish this plant from other
pond dwellers by its slimy &#8220;feel&#8221; which arises from
the fact that each thread is enclosed in a jelly-like
sheath.</p>

<p>The silk weeds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladophora Glomerata</i> are somewhat
similar in appearance to the plant we have just
described, but they are denizens of running streams
rather than of ponds. They are the green thread-like
plants we so often see attached by one end to
rocks and stones beneath running water. Each
plant consists of a long, cylindrical structure composed
of several cells. We mention the silk weeds
here, because they are best of all plants for showing
cell growth. This growth takes place at or near the
unattached end of the plant and is easily observed.
The end cell may be watched for the process. Its
green contents will be observed to contract in the
middle so that it assumes an hour-glass shape.
Then, where the contraction has taken place, we
can watch the formation of a wall right across the
cell, so that when the process is completed we have
two cells where formerly there was one. More
rarely, the contents of a cell will be observed to
bulge out a side wall, then a new wall is formed to
divide it off from the main cell and thus the beginning
of a branch is formed. The silk weeds exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
no movements, except such as are imparted to them
by the running water.</p>

<p>A very beautiful little pond plant is known to
science as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Draparnalda Glomerata</i>. We shall probably
forget its name, but we can never forget the
plant itself when once we have been fortunate
enough to see it. A single row of large, transparent
cells, containing very little green colouring matter,
forms the main part of the plant. At regular intervals
from these transparent cells, there arise rings
of deep green branches, each one tipped with an
extraordinarily long, colourless hair. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Draparnalda</i>
is indeed a plant worth looking for.</p>

<p>Two common little green plants grow so near to
the edges of ponds that they may well be included
amongst our pond plants. The simpler of the two,
known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaucheria Sessilis</i> thrives on almost any
damp soil and may even form a covering on soil in
pots. In structure, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaucheria</i> is very simple for it
consists of a single, frequently branched, tubular
cell. The little attaching organ, by means of which
the plant fixes itself to some firm support, is colourless,
so too is the tip of the cell where growth takes
place.</p>

<p>We must examine this little plant when we come
across it and we must not fail to notice that it is
composed of but one cell. The only time at which
we can find any cross walls, is when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaucheria</i> is
about to increase. Then the tip of the cell swells,
like a little club, and a cross wall separates it from
the rest of the plant. The contents of this cell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
rounds itself off, becomes fringed with innumerable
little lashing whips and escapes from a pore at the
tip of the cell in which it was formed. This little
organism swims about for a time in the water, for
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaucheria</i> only increases in this manner when it is
under water, at length it comes to rest and forms
a new plant.</p>

<p>Closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaucheria</i>, but not quite so
common, is the curious little plant known as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Botrydium Granulatum</i>. Like our previous example,
it is a one-celled plant and herein lies its
interest. When find a specimen growing by a pond,
we shall notice a green bladderlike portion, not more
than <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">6</span> inch in diameter, which projects above the
ground. Below ground, if we pick the soil away
carefully we may observe a number of colourless,
branched structures which do duty for roots. The
bladder and underground portions are hollow, being
lined in the case of the former, with a network of
chlorophyll beautiful to observe under the microscope.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Botrydium</i> usually increases by buds which form
on the green bladder, break away and grow into
new plants. Should the level of the water in the
pond rise, and the little plant become submerged,
it splits up into a number of small bodies, each
provided with a minute whip-like organ, with which
they swim rapidly ashore where they develop into
new plants. In dry weather the plant forms a
number of little cells each one surrounded by a firm
cell wall. When moisture comes again these little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
cells give rise to structures which will grow into new
plants.</p>

<p>Surpassing even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Drapernalda Glomerata</i> in point
of beauty, is the &#8220;water-net,&#8221; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydrodictyon Reticulatum</i>,
but it is not nearly so common, being confined
to ponds in the South and Midlands. When
full grown it hardly comes under the heading of
a microscopic object, for it may measure as much
as six inches in length. This remarkable pond
plant consists of an open network of green filaments.
Apart from its striking appearance the most remarkable
thing about the &#8220;water net&#8221; is its rapid
growth. Carpenter, a noted microscopist says:&mdash;&#8220;The
original cells of which the net is composed
measure one-two thousand five hundredth part of an
inch in length but in a few hours they grow to one-twelfth
of an inch or <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span> of an inch in length.
We often hear people remark that they can see
plants grow, but their statements are not literally
true; in the case of the &#8216;water net&#8217; it is actually
possible to see the growth.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the side of our pond we shall probably observe
some masses of a bluish-green jelly-like substance.
It is uninteresting-looking material for the microscope,
but we must not pass it by. The blue-green
jelly encloses a plant called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostoc</i>, which resembles
nothing so much as a necklace of beads; this we can
plainly see under a low magnification. We shall
observe that the plant is twisted spirally within its
covering and also that most of the cells, which we
have compared to beads, are similar to one another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in size. At intervals there are larger cells and as the
plant increases in length they are emptied periodically,
so they are evidently used as food stores. From
time to time portions of the plant break away, worm
their way out of the jelly and move about, rather
after the manner of a worm. Eventually, these
wanderers come to rest and become surrounded with
more of the blue-green jelly, thus forming a new
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostoc</i> colony.</p>

<p>These plants sometimes appear, apparently from
nowhere, on garden paths, walls and similar situations,
during damp autumn weather. On this account
the plants have been called &#8220;fallen stars.&#8221;
Their appearance is not so mysterious as it might
seem for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostoc</i> colony has probably been where
it is found, all through the summer, in a dried up,
contracted state. Only when rain comes, does the
jelly envelope absorb water, swell up and assume
its normal appearance. The blue-green scum which
floats on stagnant water is a closely related plant.</p>

<p>Another plant which looks like scum on the water
is known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> and a very beautiful object
it makes for the microscope. It is bright green,
without a bluish tinge, so it need not be confused
with the plant we have just mentioned. There are
seventy or so different kinds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i>, therefore
our description must be the one that will apply
to all. The plant is thread-like and, even in
the larger kinds, the threads are not more
than one-hundredth part of an inch in diameter.
Like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscillatoria</i> the plants are not attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to any support. Each thread is composed of
many cells, arranged end to end; we can distinguish
the cell walls clearly, but what will chiefly
attract our attention are the beautiful bands of
green colouring matter, running spirally, round each
cell. If we are fortunate, we shall see the plant in
the act of increasing; this is not the simple operation
we witnessed in the silk weeds. From two
threads lying parallel to one another, we shall see
swellings arise on the adjacent cell walls; the beautiful
spiral bands will begin to break up at the same
time and to collect in a mass towards the centre of
each cell. The swellings of adjacent cells touch,
their end walls break down so that the two cells
become connected, our figure shows the fusion taking
place, then the contents of one cell passes into the
adjacent cell and fuses with the contents of the
latter. The new cell, which now contains not only
its original contents but that from a cell in another
plant, becomes detached from the thread, assumes
an oval shape and sinks to the bottom of the pond,
where it rests awhile. At a later period the cell
wall bursts and a new thread of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> develops
from it.</p>

<p>When we are examining <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> we may notice
some very minute brick-red, spherical bodies adhering
to the green threads. These are little pond
animals, known by the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vampyrella Spirogyr&aelig;</i>.
This little creature passes through an interesting
and easily observed series of changes. Its
life is very uneventful, consisting of a good meal of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i>, a period of rest followed by an increase,
and this is repeated over and over again. If we
watch our little sphere through the microscope, we
may be lucky enough to see the contents divide into
four parts. Now we must watch carefully, for very
interesting events are about to take place. Each of
the four parts into which the contents of the sphere
has split, escapes into the water and swims about
for a time; it then becomes spherical, but instead
of having a smooth outer surface, as it had when we
first observed it, we can see that it is now studded
all over with very fine threads. It then wanders
along a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> plant, attaches itself to one of
the cells, perforates its wall and sucks out the
contents. This performance it repeats several times
then, evidently satiated, it loses its threads and
resumes the appearance it had when first observed
and thus it rests, till division of its contents into four
parts takes place once more and the little comedy
is repeated.</p>

<p>Now we must tear ourselves away from our pond;
there are very many interesting objects for our
microscope on the sea shore and if we delay too
long here, we shall not be able to give them the
attention they deserve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE AND PLANT LIFE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The science of botany consists of many
branches and, in most of them, the microscope
is the scientist&#8217;s constant aid. The
study of bacteria, really a branch of botany, we have
dealt with in <a href="#Page_152">another chapter</a>, so here we will omit
these interesting though lowly plants. By far the
number of botanical objects for the microscope consist
of sections&mdash;exceedingly thin slices of whatever portion
of the plant is being examined, cut either with a
sharp razor or a special instrument called a microtome.
Section cutting, though not a difficult accomplishment,
requires a considerable amount of practice
and cannot be learned from a book; all our descriptions,
therefore, will be confined to objects from the
plant world which may be studied without the assistance
of razor or microtome.</p>

<p>One cannot help being struck with the fact that
green is the prevailing colour among plants and the
reason is not far to seek. If we take a cabbage leaf
and carefully tear off the skin, we shall find green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
spongy matter below. A little of this green material
may be examined under the microscope and will
show us rounded green bodies composed of a substance
called chlorophyll. Now chlorophyll is
absolutely necessary to all plants, except the fungi
and to one or two parasitic plants. It is necessary
because, by its aid, plants can build up raw food
material into food which will be useful to them.
It is not formed in darkness; that is why a board,
a roller or any similar object left on a lawn, causes
the grass below to turn yellow; it is the reason also
why certain parts of plants, not usually green, turn
that colour when exposed to the light. Chlorophyll
does not always occur in round globules, sometimes
it is found in bands.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting botanical studies for
the microscope is furnished by the leaf of the
American water-weed. This plant, which was introduced
into the country from North America some
years ago, has now spread far and wide and is easily
obtained. A leaf which is slightly yellowed with
age is the best to take for the experiment. It should
be cut from the plant, placed at once in a small
bottle of water and kept warm for a few hours; this
may be accomplished by keeping the bottle in one&#8217;s
pocket. After a sufficient interval, put a drop of
water in a clean slide, put the portion of leaf in
the drop of water, cover with a coverslip and
examine with a moderately high power. If the
experiment has been properly carried out a wonderful
sight will reward us. We shall see that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
leaf is divided into a number of divisions called cells;
this name has been handed down from the very early
days of the microscope, because of a supposed resemblance
to the cells in a bee&#8217;s honey comb. In
each cell we shall see signs of activity, the little
round grains of chlorophyll are there, but instead
of being stationary, as in the cabbage leaf, they are
slowly moving round the walls of each cell. In
reality they are carried along in the stream of living
matter within the cell. It is a wonderful sight and
brings home to the observer very forcibly a fact
which is liable to be forgotten, that the plant is
just as much a living being as an animal. Perhaps
our experiment will not succeed at the first attempt,
then we must try again; maybe we have been too
rough in detaching the leaf or we have not kept it
sufficiently warm. Sometimes the movement may
be started by slightly warming the slide over a
flame; too much heat, of course, will kill the
leaf.</p>

<p>We shall see this green colouring matter over and
over again in our botanical studies, in fact it is found
in all manner of situations, in leaf and stem. Very
often its colour is hidden by sap of another colour,
as for instance in copper beech leaves or in the
brown seaweeds. Chlorophyll dissolves in alcohol,
however, and this affords us a ready means of
detecting its presence though we cannot see its green
colour. If we boil any leaf, suspected of containing
chlorophyll, in alcohol we shall obtain a solution
with rather peculiar properties because, when held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
up to the light it appears green, but when light is
reflected from it, it appears reddish.</p>

<p>From the under side of the cabbage leaf whence
we obtained our first specimen of chlorophyll, we
must now take another piece of skin. If we perform
the operation properly the skin will be colourless,
like a piece of thin parchment; any green colour
will show that we have torn off more than the skin
and we must make another attempt. Having
secured our piece of skin we place it in a drop of
water on a clean slide and examine it under the
microscope. We first notice that the skin is divided
up into a number of small areas called cells and
dotted here and there amongst the cells are several
oval bodies, containing chlorophyll. These oval
bodies are the pores through which the leaf breathes,
amongst other things. In the centre of each pore
there is a hole, at least there is if the pore is open,
for the two cells comprising the pore have the power
of opening and closing.</p>

<p>It is interesting to try the same experiment with a
fern leaf and to notice that there are pores, very similar
to those of the cabbage, but that the walls bounding
the cells of the leaf are irregular and that they
contain chlorophyll. We may try several other
leaves and also the upper and lower surfaces of
leaves, then we shall soon learn that, in leaves with
distinct upper and lower surfaces, there are far more
pores on the lower than the upper surface; leaves
like those of the iris have almost the same number
on each side, and floating leaves, like those of water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
lily have all their pores on the upper side. There
is a reason for this; the pores are likely to become
filled with dust, being on the lower side they are
protected somewhat; flat leaves, by their shape,
afford no protection and floating leaves must have
their pores on the upper surface to obtain air.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting things we may
learn about leaves, with the help of our microscope.
The cabbage leaf is quite smooth, but if we are
observant we shall have noticed that sometimes each
leaf appears as though it had been powdered, it has
a decided bloom. The bloom does not appear on
the leaf for ornament but for a purpose. It is a
waxy substance and it prevents the leaf from losing
moisture too quickly in dry weather. This is very
important for the plant; if the moisture taken up
from the soil were lost in the air too quickly by the
leaves, the plants would wither and eventually die.
It is not all plants which can wear a protective
covering when danger threatens, most plants have
either no protection or are permanently protected.
There is a large class of plants with folded or rolled
leaves; heather and marram grass belong to this
class. We must examine some of these leaves and
we shall find that all the pores are on the inside
of the leaf whether it be folded or rolled. The
reason for this is that moisture also escapes through
the pores and, when they are thus protected, it is
not carried off too quickly by drying winds.</p>

<p>Many plants are protected, as far as their leaves
are concerned, at anyrate, by hairs. They take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
place of the bloom in such plants as the cabbage.
There are thousands of plants with hairy leaves and
they will provide as many interesting objects for our
microscope. Let us examine as many as we can for
the hairy covering of each plant will be a little
different to the one we examined previously. There
are simple hairs, quite ordinary affairs, forked hairs,
branched hairs, T-shaped, star-shaped and club-shaped
hairs. If we are clever with our microscope
we shall notice that, however complex each
hair may be it is really nothing but one cell of the
skin of the leaf which has assumed a peculiar shape.</p>

<p>The leaves of the nettle are armed with ordinary
and stinging hairs; the latter are worth examining
and we shall notice that there is one great difference
between all the other hairs we have examined
and the stinging hairs of the nettle. The former are
of one cell only, the latter of several cells. A high
magnification will show that the stinging hair of the
nettle is not quite so simple as it appears at first
sight.</p>

<p>There are plants whose leaves are protected by
very thick skins and others whose leaves become
armed with hard flinty matter, so that they resemble
stones rather than leaves.</p>

<p>If we can find some quite young seedlings we must
manage to secure one or more for examination under
our microscope. We must take one up very carefully
and wash the earth from its roots&mdash;if we pull
the earth away our specimen will be ruined. Near
the tips of the root branches we shall see something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
which might be mistaken for mould. Our microscope
will show us that they belong to the root;
they are, in fact, root hairs. We shall very likely
be able to make out that, like the leaf hairs, each
root hair is made up of a single cell. The root hairs
are interesting because it is through them that water
is taken up by the plant from the soil.</p>

<p>In many plants a considerable space separates the
root from the leaves. When we have learned how
to cut sections, we can make slides for our microscope
which will show us the whole course along
which the water travels, from its point of entry
at a root hair to its exit at a leaf pore. Although
we have not yet reached that stage, it need not
prevent us from seeing some of the minute tubes
through which the water passes. Any fleshy
stemmed plant will serve our purpose. We must
tear it to pieces lengthways with a needle and we
shall find many threads&mdash;this is not their correct
name but it expresses our meaning&mdash;running the
whole length of the stem. They run, in fact, from
the tips of the root to the leaf, and may be seen
as leaf veins. If we remove one of these threads
and tease it with needles on a slide we shall reduce
it to still finer threads. By the way, teasing in the
sense we have used it here, means separating the
various parts. Let us examine some of these fine
threads, we shall see that some of them appear like
coiled springs at first glance. A more careful examination
will show us long tubes with spiral thickenings.
We all know the garden hose-pipe with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
stout wire coiled round it as a protection; these
tubes may clearly be compared with the familiar
hose-pipe, where the rubber portion represents the
cell wall and the stout wire the thickened parts of
the wall. There is, however, this great difference,
the wire is outside the hose-pipe, the thickened
portion of the plant tube is inside the wall. These
tubes are the ducts for water passing from root to
leaf.</p>

<p>If the agricultural side of botany attracts us we
shall not have much difficulty in finding many more
objects from the fungus world than are mentioned
in our <a href="#Page_178">chapter on Agriculture</a>, whilst the
study of bacteria may truthfully be termed never
ending. Ponds and rivers teem with vegetation suitable
for microscopic study. The testing of foods for
impurities is largely botanical work. The botanist,
of all men, need never allow his microscope to be
idle.</p>

<p>Our British insectivorous plants are of great
interest and they will supply us with some objects
for our microscope. We only possess three different
kinds of these curious plants in this country, the
Bladderworts which live in water and the Sundews
and Butterwort, which frequent moist, peaty land.</p>

<p>The pond-dwelling Bladderworts are not rare,
indeed they occur in plenty in certain localities,
but they are not very evenly distributed over the
country and in some districts one may search for
them in vain. It is worth while making a special
effort to obtain a specimen. Each plant bears a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
number of hollow structures, the bladders. There
is an entrance to each bladder, edged with stiff hairs
and closed by a trap door, which opens inwards but
will not open outwards. All these parts may be
seen under the microscope as may the interior of
a bladder; its walls are studded with short hairs.
When small water animals enter a bladder, it is
said that they do so to escape from their enemies;
they are entrapped forever, they die and eventually
decay. The juices which arise from their decaying
bodies are absorbed by the hairs lining the bladder.</p>

<p>The Sundews are pretty plants, with rosettes of
reddish leaves and minute white flowers. With the
naked eye we can usually see many drops of clear
liquid on the leaves, a number of substantial-looking
hairs and a few insects adhering thereto. If we
examine one of these hairs under the microscope,
we shall see that it is club-shaped; it is, in fact, a
hair which gives off a sticky liquid with the power of
holding any luckless insect that settles thereon and
absorbing its softer parts for the nourishment of
the Sundew. An examination of a complete leaf
with our pocket lens will show that where an insect
has settled, several of these hairs have curled over
so that they touch their victim. Because the hairs
possess this power of movement they are often
wrongly called tentacles.</p>

<p>Butterwort, like Sundew has a rosette of leaves
but they are greasy looking and pale green. Their
flowers are a pretty blue. Most probably we shall
notice that the edges of the leaves are curled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
inwards, and if we look below the curled portion
we shall surely find some captured insects undergoing
digestion. The leaf of this plant makes an
interesting object for the microscope. There are
two kinds of hairs on its surface, short stout ones
and longer knobbed ones; the former give off a
sticky liquid which holds any small insects that
touch it, the latter give off digestive juices. While
the hairs are used in digestion, after the manner of
those of Sundew, the leaf itself curls so that more
of the hairs are brought into contact with the victim
and thereby its digestion is hastened.</p>

<p>Many small flowers may be examined with low
magnifications. When we examine them thus, we
shall probably realise for the first time how beautiful
are many of these seemingly inconspicuous blossoms.
Grass flowers are always interesting; they are not
ornamental it is true, but that does not detract
from their interest. There is one part of each
flower known as the stigma; it is the part on which
the pollen grain must be placed in order that seeds
may be formed. The pollen grains are taken to the
stigmas in many ways, but the most usual agencies
are insects and wind. In the case of grasses, wind
is the agency and for that reason the stigmas of
grass flowers are feathery, so that they can easily
hold the pollen grains carried to them by the
lightest breeze. We shall probably see many pollen
grains entangled in the feathery stigma of the
flower we are examining. In the flowers of other
plants we shall find, when we magnify them, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
there are all manner of contrivances on the stigmas,
all designed for holding the pollen grains; hairs,
knobs, hooks and the like.</p>

<p>An interesting collection could be made of various
pollen grains, which are easily obtained by merely
dusting the anthers of flowers on to a clean, dry
slide. They are varied in shape, colour and size;
some are smooth, some studded with spines, others
again, those of the <em>Mallow</em> for example, have little
lids which open when the pollen grain germinates.
The germination of pollen grains is easily observed
under the microscope, by putting a few of the grains
in an exceedingly weak solution of sugar and water.
The vigil may be a long one, but if the pollen grains
are ripe and fresh, and the sugary solution sufficiently
weak, the patience of the microscopist will
be rewarded by the observance of the bursting of
the pollen grain&#8217;s coat and the outgrowth of the
pollen tube.</p>

<p>Other pollen grains worthy of examination, are
those of various lilies, of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eschscholtzia</i> and of
<em>Scotch Fir</em>; the last named have curious little air-bladders,
for the purpose of rendering them more
buoyant.</p>

<p>Many lowly plants thrive in weak sugar solutions,
after the manner of pollen grains. The yeast plant
is one of them. A very small portion of yeast, in
a drop of sugar solution, will show us one of the
simplest methods of vegetable reproduction. Yeast
is a fungus and it is also a plant composed of only
one cell. Under the microscope, it appears as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
colourless oval body. The sugar solution causes it
to multiply and, after the lapse of a little time,
most of the yeast plants will be seen to bear outgrowths,
called buds, which grow larger and larger
till, at length, they break away from the parent
plants and start a separate existence. Sometimes,
when these plants are increasing very rapidly, the
buds will bear smaller buds and these again still
smaller ones till a fairly long chain of yeast plants
is formed.</p>

<p>It is always interesting and also instructive to
make comparisons as we progress with our work.
To illustrate our meaning let us compare the budding
of the yeast plant with the budding of the hydra,
which is described in our <a href="#Page_83">chapter on pond life</a>. In
the same chapter we described the division of a
proteus animalcule into two separate organisms, a
process which is also undergone by bacteria when
circumstances are favourable to their increase. We
shall find many points of similarity if we make
careful comparisons, and several important differences.</p>

<p>Objects for the microscope we can find in plenty,
without going far afield. The white mould which
we can probably find in the larder, on a pot of jam
or other food that has been allowed to stand for
some time, will provide a good subject to start
upon. A little of this plant, for such it is, carefully
lifted on to a dry slide will show the threads of the
mould, terminated by round black knobs. Breathe
on the specimen and the moisture of your breath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
will cause these little balls to break and set free
a quantity of fine dust-like bodies called spores.
The spores will be carried about in the air, they are
so light, and if they settle on a suitable medium
they will germinate and start another growth of
mould. The blue-green mould of cheese is constructed
quite differently; its spores are not contained
in any hollow structures like those of our
first object, but grow in chains radiating from a
central point, like the outstretched fingers of the
hand. It is this fungus, by the way, which imparts
the colour and flavour to gorgonzola cheese.</p>

<p>For some reason living organisms, possessing the
power of movement, be it ever so slight, are always
more attractive than those which are apparently
motionless. Let us study two common objects from
the plant world which may easily be obtained by any
nature student, objects which owe their power of
movement&mdash;not to be confused with locomotion, by
the way&mdash;to the presence or absence of moisture in
the air. On the under side of the fronds of many ferns
there will be found more or less rounded reddish-brown
spots. These outgrowths, for such they are,
vary in position and shape according to the species
of fern. An examination, with a pocket lens, will
show that these brownish spots consist of minute
tufts of knobbed structures, growing from the tissues
of the frond. Sometimes the structures are naked,
sometimes covered with a membrane. In either
case, one or more of the knobbed structures is worth
examining under the microscope; we shall then see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that it consists of a stalk terminated by a thin
walled portion, shaped like a bi-convex lens. Round
the edge of the greater part of this lens-shaped
portion there is a much more substantial-looking
rim. Within the lens-shaped part we can easily see
brown spores. If we have chosen our object at an
opportune moment, any excessive moisture in the
air will cause the thick-walled rim to straighten itself
out, tearing away the thin-walled, lens-shaped part
in so doing and setting free the spores.</p>

<p>Closely related to the ferns, the horsetails provide
another interesting object for the microscope. The
fertile shoots of these plants, somewhat resembling
asparagus, though in reality belonging to an entirely
different family, will, when gently tapped on a clean
dry microscope slide, leave behind a pale yellow
powder. The powder consists of spores, and most
interesting they are. When dry, each spore will be
seen to have four somewhat thread-like outgrowths,
flattened at the end; breathe on the spores and each
of the outgrowths will coil up so as to form a complete
covering for the body of the spore. As drying
takes place, these outgrowths gradually uncoil
again.</p>

<p>We have mentioned spores several times in this
and other chapters. Strictly speaking a spore cannot
be compared with a seed, but for our purpose
it is sufficient to know that spores are more or less
seedlike in appearance and that they give rise to
new plants when they germinate. They are found
in all ferns, on horsetails, these odd plants with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
their creeping stems and rings of scale-like leaves,
on club mosses, mosses proper and fungi but not on
flowering plants.</p>

<p>Should the student of plant life not yet be satiated
with following the suggestions we have made, he can
turn his attention to fruits and seeds and the contrivances
designed for their distribution. The
fruits of goosegrass, popularly known as cleavers,
are studded with little hooks so that they may
adhere to any passing animal. The fruits of Burdock
are similarly armed and if we make a study
of fruits and seeds we shall find that this is a very
common method of ensuring distribution. There are
also a number of seeds covered with hairs which
render them buoyant; those of the willow herb are
easily found, so too are the fruits of dandelion,
thistle and groundsel. These and many more will
give us many an interesting hour, towards autumn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smallfont">ANIMAL LIFE AND THE MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">There are few more interesting animals than
spiders and we may spend many an hour
learning details of their structure, which
only the microscope can show, and studying their
habits, for only by doing so is it brought home to
us how astonishingly clever they are. The spider,
of course, is not an insect; it has eight legs, whereas
the insect has only six, its head and thorax are
fused, but in the case of insects head and thorax
are separate. There are many other, less evident,
points of difference as we shall see.</p>

<p>For the microscope, there are few better objects
in animal land than the feet of spiders. Their study
will give us plenty of occupation for they are modelled
on various plans, according to the different kinds
of spider. Taking the common garden spider as our
first example we shall find that its foot is a most
ingenious contrivance. Our microscope will show
us that the foot is armed with a pair of comb-like
claws. A little study of the habits of the spider will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
enlighten us concerning the uses of these combs.
At this point we may remark that the examination
of living creatures beneath the microscope should,
whenever possible, go hand in hand with a study of
habits. Over and over again in our microscopical
investigations we shall come across structures which
appear to be useless as far as we can surmise. A
careful observation of the living owners of these
puzzling structures will probably clear up the whole
matter. Well, let us watch a garden spider; if we
do so intelligently we shall see two uses of these
combs and may guess the third. The spider uses
its combs as we do, to straighten its hair; they also
clean its body. It uses them to obtain a firm grasp
of the threads of which its web is composed and,
though we cannot see this, so quick are the movements
of the creature, the combs serve a very useful
purpose in holding captured prey.</p>

<p>The garden spider and its relatives are distinguished
by the fact that, in addition to the two
large comb-like claws, they possess a third smaller
claw and some toothed spines. The small claw and
toothed spines are movable and, when pressed against
very firm grasp. With these cleverly contrived feet
she&mdash;it is always the lady spider who makes the
web and does all the work&mdash;hauls in the slack of
the combs of the larger claws afford their owner a
her web and owing to their firm grasp she can run
readily over its meshes.</p>

<p>The house spider, which spins a web seemingly in
a disordered tangle and quite unlike the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
web of the garden spider, has feet of a different
pattern. The most interesting feature about the
legs of this creature is the wonderful double comb
with which it teases out the threads of its
web as they are formed. This comb takes the
form of a double row of minute, curved spines
on the last joint but one of the hind legs; it must
certainly be examined under our microscope and
we should try to see the combs being used by the
spider.</p>

<p>We must also make a point of examining the feet
of a wolf spider for they are constructed on a
different plan to those of the spiders we have mentioned.
Wolf spiders are the creatures which spin
no proper web but lurk in holes in walls or in the
ground and dash out from their hiding places to
seize their prey. They usually line their lairs with
silk. We shall have more to say about wolf spiders
in a moment.</p>

<p>The Zebra spider, which belongs to the family of
jumping spiders, has very curious feet, not so much
on account of its claws as because of the curious
clubbed hairs which adorn them. This little spider
is black, with white stripes on body and legs; the
peculiar habit, for a spider, of leaping upon its
remarkable hairs on its feet render it exceedingly
sure-footed and it has need to be, for it exhibits
prey.</p>

<p>There are many other spiders which we may
examine with the certainty of finding some features
of interest, the Drassid spiders which lurk beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
bark and stones; the crab spiders usually brightly
coloured little fellows with the habit of living in
flowers; the little money-spinners and the harvest-men;
these last are not true spiders but they are
none the less interesting, they are the small-bodied,
very long legged creatures which occasionally find
their way into our houses.</p>

<p>Having taken our fill of the spiders&#8217; feet we may
well turn our attention to their heads. If we have
caught a spider in the act of killing a struggling
fly, it must have struck us that one bite from the
spider is sufficient to kill its victim. Let us see if
we can find the jaws which so quickly bring death
even to large insects. We shall require a steady
hand and some little skill to examine them properly
but the task is not beyond our powers. Having
killed our spider we must snip off its head, place it
on a slide and examine it with a low magnification.
Looking straight at the face, we can plainly see the
sharply pointed, hinged jaws; in nearly all spiders
they work from side to side and they can be closed
on their hinges like pocket knives. With a pair of
mounted needles and two steady hands, let us dissect
the head of our spider, so that we obtain one
of the jaws quite free from its surroundings. At
the base we shall find a little sac, the poison gland,
and if we now magnify the jaw much more highly
we shall observe a tiny hole very near the tip.
When the spider has grasped her prey in her jaws
she causes the poison from the poison glands to pass
into the body of her victim, by way of the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
hole in her jaw; the poison causes paralysis and the
victim struggles no more.</p>

<p>The only excuse we can make for spending so
much time with the spiders is that they are of the
greatest interest to the microscopist. Returning to
our friend the garden spider we must examine the
spinning organs, known as spinnerets. These are to
be found near the tip of the abdomen on the under
side. There are six pairs in all in the garden spider
but the middle pair are shorter than the others and,
in consequence, not easily seen. The tips of the
fleshy little spinnerets should be highly magnified
and we shall notice that the structure of the tips
differs in each pair of spinnerets. On the foremost
pair, there is a fairly large projection and numerous
small ones; on the middle pair three large projections
and many smaller ones, whilst on the hind pair,
in addition to the small projections there are five
large ones. The large projections are called spigots
and the small ones are known as spools; from the
former is derived the strong silk of the web, from
the spools the fine threads issue.</p>

<p>On the underside of our garden spider there is
a dark patch and, just in front of this dark spot, are
a pair of slits. These we must open up very carefully,
in a dead specimen of course, and within, if
we have succeeded in our dissection, we shall see
from fifteen to twenty little flaps resembling the
leaves of a book, in fact they are known as lung
books and, by means of them, the spider breathes.</p>

<p>One more word and we must leave the spiders.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The eyes must be examined in every specimen.
Most spiders have eight eyes, set like little gems
in the front part of the head; some have six eyes,
some only two and a few kinds are eyeless, but
these last spend all their lives in dark caves, so
eyes would be useless to them. When we examine
the eyes of wolf spiders we shall observe that they
are placed on the tops of little projections so that
their owners may better be enabled to see all around
them.</p>

<p>The hairs and scales of many spiders make
beautiful objects for the microscope. We must
make a point of examining the hairs of the water
spider also the scales from the Zebra spider. The
latter with their feathery form and iridescent colouring,
are particularly beautiful. We may advantageously
spend a moment or two in the examination
of the spider&#8217;s web and the threads of which
it is made. The strands radiating from the centre
of the web differ from those which are arranged
spirally. The latter are covered with a sticky substance
as may be seen under the microscope. When
these spiral threads are laid down by the spider,
the sticky substance covers their whole length in
a thin film, but the little architect adds a finishing
touch, by pulling the thread as a bowman pulls
his bow and then releasing it suddenly. The result
of this performance is that the sticky substance
forms a series of minute globules over the whole
length of the thread.</p>

<p>In order to be in a position thoroughly to master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the details of animal structure it is necessary to
have acquired sufficient skill to cut sections. They
cannot, however, be cut so easily as is the case with
plant sections. The various parts of animals are
either so hard, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i>, bones and teeth, that they must
be treated almost as pieces of rock and rubbed down
till they are transparent, or they are so soft that
they require soaking in various chemicals to make
them harder and even then it is usually necessary
to imbed them, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, surround them with some easily
melted substance which sets moderately hard, such
as paraffin wax. Cutting sections of animal parts
is beyond the average amateur.</p>

<p>The feathers of birds make beautiful objects for
the microscope. For those microscopists who desire
beauty of colour rather than details of structure
it is hard to beat the glorious shades of certain
feathers beneath the microscope. To obtain the
best effect a fairly low magnification should be used
and all manner of lighting thrown upon the object,
for we have all seen the feather which appears drab
at one angle is of the greatest brilliance at another.
Various feathers and from various parts of birds
should be examined, if we desire to understand their
structure. Each feather consists of a vast number of
cells but it is improbable that we shall be able to
prove this statement by the examination of any
large feather. We must take a down feather, notice
carefully the arrangement of its various parts, for
it will be interesting to compare this soft, weak
feather with a comparatively strong flight feather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
from a wing. Now, under a higher magnification,
we can plainly see the little cells of which the down
feather is built up.</p>

<p>One of the strong wing feathers of such a bird
as a pigeon is of the greatest interest as a microscopic
object. We must take a few of the barbules,
the slender, flattened portions of the feather which
fringe either side of the barb. A moderately high
magnification will show how ingeniously they are
contrived. The hinder side of each barbule is a
moderately thick upwardly curved edge whilst, on
the forward side, there is a row of curved hooks.
When the feather is neat and tidy, and its owner
when in good health usually sees to it that its
feathers are well kept, the hooks of one barbule
engage with the curved edge of the next barbule.
The feather, by means of this ingenious locking
device, becomes much more nearly a solid structure
than would be the case if the barbules did not hook
on to one another. The arrangement for hooking
together the fore and hind wings of bees and wasps
is very similar. We may examine a number of
flight feathers but we shall not find any very striking
differences between those of various birds. All,
apparently, follow a common design.</p>

<p>From feathers to hair and from hair to horns and
some scales is not a very far cry. We have talked
about the examination of hair in another chapter,
so we will not repeat ourselves here. Scales we
shall most of us have opportunities of examining in
plenty. We have just mentioned that some scales<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are comparable to hairs and feathers. Such scales
are to be found in snakes and lizards. The scales
of fish are of a different order but they are equally
or even more interesting when examined under the
microscope.</p>

<p>If we live in a district where many and various
fish are caught we shall soon discover that their
scales differ in a remarkable degree. Some are of
the texture of horn, some are gristly, some bony
and some covered with enamel, after the manner
of teeth. Not only do they differ in texture but in
design as we shall see in a moment.</p>

<p>Certain fishes, the eel is one, the mackerel another,
are said to be scaleless. As a fact their scales are
very thin and transparent and so arranged that they
are less evident than those of other fish. By taking
a little of the skin of one of these fish we can easily
detach a few scales for examination. Those of the
eel we shall find are very thin and delicate
and quite transparent. These and all other fish-scales
may be made into permanent slides by mounting
in Canada Balsam, as described in our <a href="#Page_97">last
chapter</a>.</p>

<p>The carp, whiting, salmon, sprat, herring and
many other fish have scales called cycloid or circular;
the term is rather a misnomer because they are not
truly circular, but the name is used to distinguish
them from other scales. The structure is easily
made out with a moderate magnification. Many of
these scales, however, exhibit portions more dense
than the rest; these dense spots are caused by little
particles of lime which may be seen under a higher
magnification.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Perch, pike, sole and some other fish have much
more peculiar scales, known as ctenoid or combed
for the reason that their unattached, that is to say
their hinder margins, are toothed like a comb.</p>

<p>The scales of sharks, dog-fish and rays are called
placoid for they are toothed; not only so but their
arrangement is frequently quite dissimilar to the
scales of ordinary fish. Taking the herring as our
example, but a salmon or any other fish would serve
equally well, and examining the arrangement of its
scales with the help of our pocket lens, we shall
find that the scales are fixed to the fish by their
forward edges and that each scale partly overlaps
its neighbour, as do tiles on a roof. In the shark
family, however, the scales are often relatively wide
apart, they do not overlap but are imbedded
separately in the skin. The scales of rays have each
a hard spine projecting from the centre, those of
sharks and dog-fish have teeth, and they are teeth
not only in appearance but also in structure.</p>

<p>The ganoid scales of sturgeon we are hardly likely
to meet with. Sometimes these fish are on sale in
London and other large towns and a specimen of
their scales may be procured. They are bony in
structure and, though interesting, require a considerable
amount of preparation to render them
sufficiently transparent to be examined under the
microscope.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that all the fossil fish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which are discovered from time to time have either
ganoid or placoid scales, a fact which shows that
the sharks, rays and sturgeon are directly descended
from creatures which swam the seas thousands of
years ago.</p>

<p>The shells of shell-fish are not easy to examine
microscopically, but frequently their plates may be
detached from the edges of such shells as oysters
and mussels and these should be examined. If the
outer part of the shell be taken we can easily see its
honeycomb structure and, by adding a little acid
and waiting till all action has ceased, we shall have
a structure remaining which is remarkably like a
number of plant cells. The inner layer of many of
these shells is composed of beautifully iridescent
mother-of-pearl. Now such iridescence is usually
caused by surfaces furrowed with many very fine
lines and mother-of-pearl is no exception. Under
the microscope, with a moderately high magnification,
we can see minute striations all practically
parallel to one another.</p>

<p>The cuttlefish is peculiar in having a skeleton
which is a moderately soft plate. These plates can
often be found washed up by the tide, may be cut
out from a dead cuttlefish or bought from a chemist&#8217;s
as cuttlefish bone. However we secure the material
we shall find that one side of the &#8220;bone&#8221; is hollow
and that across this hollow, delicate plates run
parallel to one another at intervals. Between these
parallel plates there appear to be a number of fibres
but, if we cut a thin slice of the structure and examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
it under the microscope, we shall see that
the apparent fibres are really very thin plates of
bone which wind and double upon themselves in
a beautiful manner. The structure of these plates
gives strength to the bone without adding to its
weight.</p>

<p>Snails are sure to attract the microscopist sooner
or later, so too are slugs. Many of the latter have
shells, small flat or ear-shaped shells, quite different
to the portable homes of snails. In many young
snails, which may be killed by dropping into boiling
water, we can find the shells so transparent that they
form good objects for our microscope. Sometimes
they are composed of six-sided cells, sometimes of
beautiful star-shaped cells.</p>

<p>From the microscopist&#8217;s point of view the most
interesting feature of the snail is its rasping organ,
often wrongly termed the tongue. To find this
organ it is necessary to open up the mouth of a
dead snail, and if we seek the assistance of our lens
while doing so, we shall have no difficulty in finding
the rasp&mdash;it may be recognised by the minute teeth
with which it is furnished. The whole structure
should be carefully removed and mounted upon a
slide. In some kinds of snails there are but a
hundred teeth, other kinds, however, possess as
many as twenty-six thousand eight hundred. The
snail makes use of this remarkable organ to procure
its food. Vegetation is pressed against a plate at
the top of the creature&#8217;s mouth and literally filed
into small pieces by the rasping organ. Captive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
water snails may be watched while using their rasp
upon the water plants or upon the green slime which
soon accumulates in aquaria. The eggs of snails
are easily found and should be examined, the queer
little inmates may be studied through the transparent
shells, in all stages of development.</p>

<p>The naturalist whose inclinations lead him towards
the study of animal life will find plenty to occupy
his time and his microscope. All kinds of eggs of
small creatures may be watched as they develop.
Frogs&#8217; eggs are of interest in this respect, so too
are tadpoles which hatch from them. The whole
blood circulation in a young tadpole may easily be
studied under the microscope, the structure of the
external gills, the gradual change to internal gills,
the development of legs, the absorption of the tail.
The tadpole and its marvellous changes will afford
sufficient microscopic material to last for many
weeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE STUDY OF THE ROCKS</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The study of rocks and minerals by means
of the microscope is apt to be disappointing.
In the first place, to study them
seriously we require a special microscope, the ordinary
instrument, with which we may poke into
the deepest secrets of the animal and plant world
cannot translate for us half the story of the rocks.
Again, to understand rocks and minerals we must
study them somewhat deeply. Geology, as the
science of rocks is called, is no more difficult
than botany or zoology, the sciences of plants
and animals respectively. Botany and zoology,
however, appeal in some degree to nearly all
of us; we may learn a good deal concerning the
structure of the cockroach with the help of our
microscope and be interested in the revelations of
our instrument, but to embark on a detailed course
of the minute internal anatomy of insects would
appeal to few of us. Animal or plant life may be
studied piecemeal and enjoyed on account of its
absorbing interest. Geology must be studied from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
its very beginnings if we are really to understand
what we see beneath the microscope.</p>

<p>In the hand, a lump of rock, say of granite, may
be of exceeding beauty. The body of the rock is,
perhaps, a delicate pink, scattered here and there
are the flat glittering plates of mica and brilliant
crystals of quartz. Other rocks, less common, vie
with the rare gems for beauty of colouring and
lustre. As thin microscope sections these once
gorgeous specimens are colourless, dull and, unless
we understand them, uninteresting.</p>

<p>There are, however, many mineral substances
which we may study with advantage for, if our
investigations do not take us very far towards
elucidating the story of the rocks, we shall at any
rate discover something that is new to us. We may
well commence our studies with the examination
of ordinary sand. This is not a rock, you will
probably exclaim. You are right but one day it
may be a rock, it all depends upon circumstances.</p>

<p>Before we take out our microscope let us have
a short talk about rocks in general, then we may
understand better where we are. Rocks of one
kind and another make up the crust of the earth,
that is pretty obvious anyway. Thousands and
thousands of years ago, how many we are not prepared
to guess, this old earth of ours was a sphere
of molten rock. Needless to say it was far too hot
for any plants or animals to dwell upon it. Very,
very gradually the outer crust cooled down and in
time it became sufficiently cool to support animal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and vegetable life. Then there were rivers and seas
and then came, from time to time, rain and wind
and frost and even earthquakes. The earthquakes
cracked the crust of the earth, moisture entered
the cracks and, when the frosts came, pieces of rock
were broken away, owing to the expansion of the
moisture in the cracks as it became converted into
ice. The rain and wind helped to carry the broken
pieces of rock, ever downwards towards the sea, but
before the sea was reached the big boulders became
broken up, by their buffeting, into shingle and sand
and mud. In the course of long ages, longer than
it is easy to imagine, these broken pieces of rock,
gathered together as we have seen from various
districts, may have been left high and dry, for the
face of the earth has not always been as we know
it now.</p>

<p>In time all the little particles became welded
together to form a new kind of rock. Sometimes
animals and plants were buried in the mud destined
to become a rock and their parts were so well preserved
that they may not only be recognised by
present-day scientists, but in many cases their
structure may be made out so well with the aid of
a microscope that no one would guess they had been
buried thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>New rocks have been formed not only by the
breaking up and welding together of the original
earth&#8217;s crust, but by animal and plant remains. In
some places, in past ages, billions and billions of
little shell-fish have lived in the waters, died there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and their shells have fallen to the bottom of their
watery home. Now we know their shell remains as
chalk or if it has undergone great pressure, owing
to changes in the earth&#8217;s surface, as limestone.
There are rock masses also formed of the remains
of countless Diatoms; sponge spicules, too, have
played their part in rock formation.</p>

<p>It is clear from what we have written that, in
the first place, the rocks of the earth form two
great divisions, the rocks which formed the original
crust of the earth, Primary rocks they are called,
and the later-formed Secondary rocks. The Primary
rocks are often glassy in appearance, they show unmistakable
signs of having once been molten and they
never contain animal or plant remains, fossils as they
are called, for the reason we have already explained.
The secondary rocks often betray their origin by
occurring in layers, or strata to speak more scientifically.
Always when we think of the rocks we must
think in thousands of years, then it will be easier
to understand the formation of these strata, each
one of which may represent the work of hundreds
and hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Now to return to our sand; we have explained
briefly that sand is really the remains of broken up
rocks. First we have the solid rock, boulders are
broken from it as the boulders are acted upon by
rain, frost and wind: they become more and more
broken up and at the same time they are carried
towards the sea where they take the form of shingle.
The shingle, in the course of time, becomes broken
up into sand, and the sand again becomes so finely
divided that it forms mud. From this it is clear
that the composition of the sand depends largely
on the nature of the rocks in the neighbourhood.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>First of all, we must place a little of our sand
upon a piece of black paper and examine by reflected
light. We shall soon notice that sand is
anything but the simple gritty looking substance it
appears on the sea shore. At least four different
substances are certain to be seen; if the sand be
clean, we shall see bright glassy crystals of quartz;
angular, sharp-edged pieces of flint; minute, flat,
glistening plates of mica and the broken remains of
shells. Should our sand be taken from a spot in
the vicinity of volcanic rocks, it will probably contain
opaque pieces of magnetite; we may not
recognise these when we see them, but they may
be separated from the rest of the sand by means
of a magnet, to which they will adhere. Probably
our sample of sand will be dirty or stained with
iron, in this event we may wash it with weak
acid, then after drying, we may examine by
transmitted light and the various crystals will
show up well.</p>

<p>Let us take some clay as our next example.
Clay is the substance from which the rocks known
as shale and slate have been formed. We cannot
see much of the structure of clay with our microscope
so let us wash it and, by so doing separate
it into its components. We must put a little clay
into a tumbler of water and stir it vigorously for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
some little time, then still stirring, if we pour off
the muddy liquid into another tumbler, we shall
find that our old friend sand has settled to the
bottom. Clay then is merely mud and sand, but
we must not throw this sand away without examining
it for, very frequently, beautiful minute fossils
are to be found amongst it. Little creatures dwelling
in the mud, become buried in it and, as more
and more mud is formed above them, and it becomes
partly solidified in the form of clay, they become
fossilized.</p>

<p>If now we examine a piece of sandstone with our
pocket lens we shall find that it very closely resembles
the sand we have already studied. It may
be so soft that we can break it up in our fingers,
then if we examine the powdered sandstone beneath
the microscope we shall need to be experts to tell
whether we are examining sand or sandstone. Should
our rock be too hard to break up in our fingers the
addition of a little weak acid will reduce it to sand.
We see now that a large proportion of sand and
a small proportion of mud result in the formation
of sandstone, whereas if the proportions are reversed
and we have more mud than sand the resulting rock
is known as shale or slate. In shale we very frequently
find fossils, in sandstone rarely, for the
reason that structures buried in the mud, destined
to become shale, are protected from the atmosphere
and the action of water; sandstone, on the other
hand, is porous, moisture trickles through it and any
delicate structures which may have been buried in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
it are more likely to decompose than to become
fossilized.</p>

<p>Limestone is easy to obtain and may occupy us
for a few moments. We do not wish to go into
technical details, but we may say that the word
limestone includes a number of rocks which differ
largely in appearance and to a considerable extent
in composition. It would, perhaps, be more correct
to say that there are several kinds of limestone.
Some kinds are made up almost entirely of shells
and very interesting they are as microscopic objects.
One may wonder how a geologist can state with
certainty that some spot, may be many miles from
the sea, was once covered by salt water. One of
these shell-formed limestones may give him the information;
he knows that certain shells comprising
the rock must have belonged to marine animals, he
knows too that whole mountains, which these rocks
sometimes form, are not carried bodily on to dry
land, so the obvious inference is that the rock was
formed below the sea.</p>

<p>The softer limestones may easily be crumbled and
powdered for examination under the microscope;
the harder kinds should be treated with acid. When
acid is added to limestone a considerable effervescence
takes place, for the acid decomposes a substance
known as calcium carbonate, which the limestone
contains, and bubbles of gas are given off.
When the limestone has ceased to effervesce the
portions of the rock which remain, may be carefully
washed in water, dried and examined under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
microscope. We shall find that the substance we
examine consists of sand containing a goodly number
of plates of mica and there may also be a number
of sponge spicules. We must bear in mind when
we are examining the remnants of limestone after
treatment with acid, that shells are largely composed
of calcium carbonate, so it is useless to look for
any shell remains, for the acid will have dissolved
them.</p>

<p>Calcium carbonate, in a nearly pure state, will
and does form rock-like structures; we are most of
us familiar with stalactites which are formed on the
roofs of caves. These structures are usually composed
of calcium carbonate though sometimes,
notably in some of the Derbyshire caves, Barium
takes the place of Calcium. Should we have the
chance of examining a section of a stalactite we
should certainly do so. We can see the rings which
are formed, as layer after layer of calcium carbonate
is deposited, in fact the section of a stalactite bears
a striking resemblance to a stem of a tree and has,
before now, been mistaken for a fossil stem.</p>

<p>If the study of rocks appeals to us we should
make a point of examining all the specimens we
can lay hands upon. Many quite common specimens
may easily be obtained; rock-salt, for example,
though in itself not of great interest as an
object for the microscope, will readily dissolve in
water, leaving behind an insoluble residue of iron
which is well worth examination. The majority of
rocks, however, are not affected by water and but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
little by acids. With such specimens the only course
open to the microscopist is to prepare sections.</p>

<p>The making of rock sections is certainly different
to the cutting of plant or animal sections. It is
a laborious business as the enthusiast will find to
his cost. The professional makers of rock sections
have special grindstones or lathes for the purpose
and, even so, the process is not rapid. The amateur
must needs do all his preparation by hand. The
requirements, in addition to the piece of rock of
which we require a section, are a small square of
plate glass, some Canada Balsam, emery powder of
various grades and an unlimited stock of patience.
If possible we choose a piece of rock with one side
as nearly as possible flat; this is merely to save
labour; the piece of rock should be roughly about
half-an-inch square. As a start we rub the flattest
side in a mixture, practically a paste, of coarse
emery powder and water. As a matter of fact, we
may keep the piece of rock in our pocket and grind
it when occasion offers on a flat stone wall or on
any surface that will assist in producing a flat
surface. When we have ground our surface flat and
smooth, we finish it off with fine emery powder
and may then polish it with jeweller&#8217;s rouge. So
much for the first side and, if we do not cry enough
at this period, we may proceed to the grinding of
the other side. Taking our slab of plate glass, we
fasten the polished side of our piece of rock to it
by means of Canada Balsam, then we may rest for
a few days while the Balsam sets. As soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
rock is firmly fixed to the glass we proceed as before,
but in this case the final grinding and polishing
must be very carefully carried out. Towards the
end of the operation our original lump of rock will
be reduced to the thinness of a cover slip and to its
fragility. Having given the finishing touches with
jeweller&#8217;s rouge, we put the glass, with its attached
rock section into a bottle of xylol (to be obtained
from any chemist). The xylol dissolves the Canada
Balsam and the rock section falls from its support.
A further washing in clean xylol should be given
and then the section is ready for mounting, which
is best done in Canada Balsam. The section may
be carefully fixed to the slide with a drop of Balsam
or it may be covered with a cover slip, in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#Page_291">concluding chapter</a> we give hints on slide
making and addresses of firms who supply slides.
Our advice in that chapter is to prepare one&#8217;s own
slides where possible; in the case of rock sections,
however, we must change our advice, only the
microscopist of unlimited leisure can find time to
make his own slides.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting branches of rock study
deals with the fossil remains of plants and animals.
Fossils are interesting in themselves: they are doubly
interesting because they tell us more than we could
ever have discovered without them, concerning the
living forms which inhabited the earth at different
periods. Geologists know the order in which the
various secondary rocks were formed and by studying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the fossils of these various rock formations, from
the earliest to the latest, can tell which animals and
plants have been longest upon the earth. Some of
the living forms of to-day have existed from very
early times; we know, for example, that cockroaches
were upon the earth long ages ago, for their
fossil remains are found in the very early rocks.</p>

<p>For the most part the fossils of animal forms do
not make good objects for the microscope. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foraminifera</i>, minute creatures dwelling in shells,
are the most suitable for microscopic examination
and very beautiful some of them are. They are best
examined by reflected light, for then their little
shells show their delicate pearly sheen.</p>

<p>Sponge spicules, as may be guessed from their
hardness, are common in the fossil state; there are
also fossils of sea-anemone ancestors and fossils also
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i> colonies. The last named, known as
graptolites, look not unlike lead-pencil marks on the
rock. They exist in many forms; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diplograptus</i> has
a stem with two rows of cups in which the little
creatures lived long ages ago; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monograptus</i> has
but one row of cups upon its stem, whilst <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Didymograptus</i>
is a branched form. These fossils are by
no means rare and are worth studying under the
microscope.</p>

<p>There are curious fossils knows as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trilobites</i>, not
unlike the present-day wood lice; they too may be
studied, for some of them show all their characteristic
markings as plainly as they must have appeared
on the living animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>In the plant world, many fossils in amazingly,
good states of preservation have been found. Some
of the giant Club Mosses from the coal measures,
exhibit all the characteristic stem markings, leaf
scars and the like, so clearly that one might imagine
one examined a living specimen. Most of the plant
remains are beyond the reach of the amateur, but
many of them may be viewed in museums, in
different parts of the country and the microscopist,
whether he be a student of rocks or a lover of plants,
should make a point of examining them. From
quite fragmentary remains, scientists have been able
to conjecture what vegetation covered the earth at
various ages. The present is the age of flowering
plants, but long ago the world was green with giant
Club Mosses and Horsetails, very humble plants at
the present time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE AS DETECTIVE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It is an unfortunate fact that our food is not
always absolutely pure. It may be contaminated
with foreign matter either by accident
or by design. However careful the manufacturer
may be in, say the preparation of cocoa, some dust,
some waste vegetable matter, perhaps even a few
stray dried insects may occur as impurities. They
are out of place certainly but, at the worst, they are
a sign of lack of care on the part of the manufacturer.
There is another, more serious side to the question of
food adulteration, where the foreign matter is added
purposely, either because it is cheap, because it
weighs heavily, imparts a pleasing colour or an
agreeable aroma. Such adulteration is a form of
fraud and the microscope is an invaluable aid in
its detection.</p>

<p>In many respects the microscope is a better
informant than the tests of the chemists; in some
cases, however, it merely supplements and confirms
the chemical results. Let us consider, for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the advantages possessed by the microscope and
also where chemistry scores.</p>

<p>Very frequently the results of costly law cases
hang on the reports of expert food examiners; every
care, therefore, must be taken to avoid error. This
being the case, whenever possible, chemical tests
should be carried out to confirm the results of microscopic
examination. When both microscopist and
chemist come to the same conclusion, there is not
likely to be any mistake. There are tests which
the microscope cannot perform, there are some,
also, which are beyond the powers of the chemist
and many which are very difficult for him. A drop
of milk, for example, examined under the microscope
shows a number of fat globules floating in
a watery liquid. However clever the microscopist
and however accurate his instrument, he cannot tell
if there is an excessive quantity of water, yet a
simple chemical test will answer the question. This
is a case in which the microscope is of little use,
although it is only fair to add that microscopic
examination would reveal the presence of blood,
hair and dirt, to mention three common impurities,
which the chemist in his test for watered milk would
quite overlook. With a little care and the use of
suitable stains, any bacteria which might be present
would also show plainly under a powerful microscope.</p>

<p>Now for an example or two where the microscopist
has the advantage of the chemist. Some
jam makers have been known to be sufficiently unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to sell &#8220;raspberry&#8221; jam contaminated
with a large percentage of some cheaper fruit, such
as gooseberry. The seeds of the two fruits differ so
markedly that it is really not necessary to employ
a microscope to discover the fraud, but a case is on
record where wooden seeds were used, so like the
true seeds of the raspberry, that a very careful
examination was necessary to show what had happened.
In our <a href="#Page_178">chapter on the Microscope in Agriculture</a>
we have referred to this point in greater
detail. Starch of various kinds is a very common
food adulterant and the experienced microscopist
can estimate almost precisely, the proportions of
different starches in a mixture, a feat which would
sorely puzzle the chemist. So in certain cases the
microscope is indispensable.</p>

<p>Briefly the microscope is a time saver; chemical
tests occupy a considerable time; microscopic examination
is quick, the experienced microscopist at
once recognises what he observes. Very small
quantities can be examined under the microscope,
relatively large quantities are required for chemical
tests. Again, if only a small quantity of the
material is available for examination and it is necessary
to carry out chemical tests, they can be performed
under the microscope and this point is
considered in another chapter.</p>

<p>We have mentioned that starch of various kinds
is a common adulterant of many foods and the
budding food analyst might do worse than learn
to recognise the various starch grains under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
microscope. They are easily obtained and as easily
observed. Each variety of starch has grains which
are remarkably constant in their characteristics. A
beginning may profitably be made with potato
starch, for its grains are large and they possess
certain well-marked features, which may or may not
be present in the grains of other starches. By scraping
the newly cut surface of a potato we can obtain
thousands of starch grains. The surface of the
potato must not be grated, just a gentle scraping
with a pocket knife and a mere speck of the cloudy
liquid that is obtained, added to a drop of clean
water on our slide, will suffice. Cover the object
with a cover glass and examine under a fairly high
magnification. There are countless, oval, almost
transparent bodies in our field of view, they are
potato starch grains. Each one, as we shall see
when we make a more careful examination, is not
unlike a miniature oyster-shell. In the shell, there
is a point which is its oldest part and the remainder
has grown, layer by layer, round that point till the
shell is fully formed. Now we magnify the starch
grains as highly as possible and slowly rotate the
fine adjustment to and fro, for the reason that the
object is not flat and by doing so, we obtain all its
parts in focus in turn. If the illumination is not too
intense, we shall notice a minute dark dot corresponding
to the oldest part of the oyster shell; it
is, in fact, the oldest part of the starch grain.
Around this point we can see as we focus up and
down, ring after ring where the grain has grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
larger and larger. The dark spot is called the
hilum and the rings are known as striations. In the
potato starch grain the hilum is not central and the
striations are not circular. Wheat has large and
almost round grains without a hilum or striations,
those of Barley are very similar but smaller and not
so uniformly round. Rye grains are frequently
cracked and often have ragged edges.</p>

<p>A very large number of these objects may be
examined, for it is useful to know their structure
if one&#8217;s object be to examine various foods; from
the point of view of beauty, when examined with
a polariscope, they have few rivals. Maize starch,
which is to be found in most houses under the name
of corn flour consists of two kinds of grain. Some are
many sided and angular, all of one size and without
striations, they are also split at the centre; the other
grains are rounded, of various sizes and are never like
the angular grains grouped together. The former
come from the horny part of the maize, the latter
from the floury portion.</p>

<p>Rice starch is also many sided and angular,
almost crystal like; there are, however, never any
rounded forms and this serves to distinguish it from
maize starch. The shape of Arrowroot starch
grains varies according to the plant from which it
is derived, for this substance does not all come from
one kind of plant but, whether the grains be pear
shaped, hammer shaped, triangular or dumbell
shaped they all show striations and an x-shaped
split in place of a hilum. Tapioca starch grains are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
usually grouped together in twos or threes; when
they rest on their flat surfaces they appear circular
and each hilum is surrounded by a dark ring, when
on their sides they are seen to be sugar-loaf
shaped.</p>

<p>Many more starches can be found without going
far afield, Sago, Peas, Beans, Lentils and Bananas
are a few common commodities containing starch.
An effort should be made to study the very curious
dumbell shaped starch grains of the Spurge and its
relations. All these plants contain a white milky
juice in which the starch grains float; by squeezing
a little of this milky fluid into a drop of water on
a clean slide the grains can easily be observed.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to observe starch grains
till a fair amount of experience has been gained in
the use of the microscope. Should this difficulty arise,
it may be overcome by adding a drop of a weak
solution of iodine. This will stain the starch grains
a deep blue colour and render them very easy of
observation. The iodine solution must be weak,
however, or the staining will be excessive and the
objects rendered black and non-transparent.</p>

<p>Having examined many or all of the specimens
we have mentioned let us turn our attention to some
of the common foods, and learn some of the methods
used in testing for impurities. Ordinary household
bread, it is hardly necessary to state, is rich in
starch and, by trying the iodine test, mentioned
above its presence is easily shown. With a weak
solution the deeper the blue colour produced, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
greater the quantity of starch. Some parts of the
bread will be stained yellow, this indicates the
presence of another nourishing component of bread.
Certain kinds of bread are supposed to contain no
free starch, because this substance is not beneficial
to some people. Iodine again will reveal whether
the bread is as it is described, for, if there be no
free starch there will be no blue colouration. Brown
bread will show much more of the yellow colouration
and less of the blue than white bread. Good,
well-baked bread should keep for a considerable
period without turning sour; we can easily see
whether our sample is satisfactory by running a
drop of litmus on to it and watching the effect under
the microscope; if the litmus remains unchanged
in colour the sample is not sour; if, on the other
hand, the litmus turns red it shows us that acid
is present and that our bread is not as it
should be.</p>

<p>Tea is difficult to prepare for microscopic examination
and most of the tests call for expert knowledge,
not only in the management of the microscope but
of the plant itself. The structure of the leaves can
be made out clearly in specimens which have been
soaked for a time in water, but this is of little interest
to the ordinary microscopist. One very pretty
test may, however, easily be performed. We all know
that it is not good to drink tea which has been
standing for a long time. Some tea-drinkers are so
particular that they cannot bear to see the teapot
shaken before they have poured out their cup. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
this trouble arises because tea contains a poison
called &#8220;theine&#8221;; it is an alkaloid, one of a large
class of chemical substances which are nearly all
deadly poisons&mdash;cocaine and nicotine are alkaloids.
Although theine is poisonous, tea which contained
none of this substance would be tasteless and the
absence of this substance shows that the tea leaves
have been badly prepared. Tea after being gathered
should be dried at once, sometimes it is re-dried
and this process drives off the theine. For our test
we require, in addition to our microscope, two
watch glasses, a piece of copper wire gauze and a
gas burner or a spirit lamp. Place a little tea in
one of the watch glasses and cover with the other
watch glass; then heat gently on the wire gauze.
In a few minutes drops of moisture will appear on
the upper watch glass; after about ten minutes&#8217;
heating beautiful, long, needle-shaped crystals will
begin to appear, with a little further heating we shall
obtain a good crop of lovely crystals on the upper
watch glass and they make a splendid object for
examination under a low magnification. The crystals
are of theine, the poisonous component of tea, and
the test is used to discover whether the tea has been
redried during its preparation; redried tea gives no
crystals.</p>

<p>The examination of cocoa for impurities is a
matter rather for the chemist than for the microscopist.
It contains a vast number of starch grains,
not unlike those of rice, except that they are
rounded. Coffee often contains a number of impurities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the chief being chicory, various starches,
ground acorns and date stones. Chicory is really
an impurity, though it is one often asked for by
coffee-drinkers. It is easy to detect the amount of
chicory present in a sample of ground coffee, by
throwing a little of the mixture on to water. The
chicory sinks at once, whereas the coffee floats
for a while because it is oily. In pure coffee there
should be no starch and the iodine test will readily
show whether we are dealing with a sample free
from starch or not.</p>

<p>Mustard is very rarely purposely mixed with any
impurities, in fact it is probably the least likely to
be adulterated of any article of food. Under the
microscope a large number of small objects, very
similar to starch grains, can be seen. They are
the cells containing mustard oil and they are not
stained blue by iodine. A specimen of pure
mustard contains no starch. Pepper is by no means
easy to test for impurities. It contains minute
starch grains, which can be recognised under the
microscope after staining. It is mentioned here
because of a very interesting and easily performed
experiment that will appeal to every microscopist.
Place a little pepper on a clean slide and moisten
it with a drop of alcohol, allow it to stand for a
minute or so then add a little dilute glycerine, cover
the specimen with a cover glass and examine it
under the microscope after the lapse of about five
minutes. The sight of wonderful prismatic crystals
forming one by one in rapid succession will be ample<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
reward for the trouble taken. A drop of strong
nitric acid, which must not be allowed to come in
contact with any part of the microscope or with
one&#8217;s hands or clothes, will turn the crystals a rich
orange colour. The crystals are composed of a
substance called piperine.</p>

<p>Everyone knows of the importance of pure water
for drinking purposes but the word pure in this
case is used in a very wide sense, for the only really
pure water is distilled water and it would not form
a very good beverage. Although ordinary tap water
may contain a number of impurities it is not easy
to see them without taking a little trouble. If our
tap water is so contaminated that a drop, examined
at random, shows us all manner of solid matter
floating in the water there must be something
seriously wrong. Those who are engaged in testing
water under the microscope, first take a big jug
full of the water and allow it to stand for twenty-four
hours, covering it the while to keep out dust.
At the end of this time most of the water is carefully
drawn off, from the top, with a siphon and
the remainder, after stirring is poured into a conical
glass and allowed to stand for a further twelve
hours. Then the upper portion of the water is
again siphoned off and a little of the remainder,
which is left in the point of the conical glass is
drawn by suction into a special kind of glass tube,
called a pipette. This final sample contains all the
solid matter which settles to the bottom of the water
after standing for thirty-six hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The impurities likely to be present in water make
such a formidable list that we can only mention
a small number. There may be various mineral
substances, such as lime, sand or clay; vegetable
substances, starch grains, fragments of wood, pieces
of decayed leaves and the like or there may be hair,
scales of fish, etc. The impurities may be living
plants, of which the most likely to be found are
bacteria, diatoms, desmids and Volvox, amongst
plants, and rotifers, Vorticella, Param&oelig;cium,
Am&oelig;ba, also portions of tapeworms and their eggs
amongst animals. These creatures are all described
elsewhere so we need not dwell on their peculiarities
here.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the above and many more
not mentioned there are four metals commonly found
in impure water, either in small solid particles, or
in the form of one of their compounds soluble in
water. The metals are iron, copper, zinc and lead.
Very simple chemical tests will show whether they
are present or not. To a drop of the water add
a very minute quantity of hydrochloric acid and of
potassium ferrocyanide solution. When iron is
present the solution will turn blue; in the presence
of copper it will become bronze coloured, whilst
zinc turns it a milky white. To detect lead, take
another drop of water and add a very small quantity
of potassium chromate solution. If the suspected
impurity is present the solution turns yellow. All
the chemicals for these simple tests may be obtained
at any chemists and there is this great advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in testing under the microscope&mdash;only very small
quantities are required.</p>

<p>Butter can hardly be described as an interesting
object for the microscope, nevertheless, it may be
of use to explain the methods of its examination.
A small sample should be placed upon a clean slide,
a drop of olive oil added and the whole covered
with a cover slip which may be pressed firmly till
the specimen forms but a thin layer. Of course the
most important impurities likely to be present are
bacteria but these we cannot see without special
preparation and we are not dealing with bacteria
in the present chapter.</p>

<p>If our specimen is in a film sufficiently thin to be
transparent, and we should have made it so by
pressure on the cover slip, we may first of all
examine it carefully for starch grains which, by the
way, should be absent. The amount and size of the
drops of water, which every butter sample contains,
are of importance in deciding its quality. In good
butter there are a few scattered drops of various
sizes; in milk-blended butter the water globules
are all very small and all of the same size, or as
nearly so as the eye can judge; in butter containing
an excessive amount of water the drops appear large,
much larger than in a normal sample.</p>

<p>If we examine various samples, we shall find that
some are much more transparent than others, the
transparent samples being fresh butter. The curd
also in fresh samples is much more finely and evenly
scattered in the field of view than in older samples.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Renovated butter, that is to say rancid butter which
has been melted and made palatable by forcing
steam through it, should be examined by oblique
light&mdash;easily arranged by tilting the mirror at an
angle&mdash;when the curd appears as white patches on
a dark background.</p>

<p>It is curious that one article of food, honey, is
more likely to be pure when it contains impurities.
This sounds like a bull but a great deal of honey
is manufactured from various sugars but not by
bees. This artificial honey contains no pollen grains,
in fact any honey found to be free of pollen should
be looked upon with suspicion. Starch often occurs
in artificial honey, never in real bee-made honey.</p>

<p>To many foods adulterants are added as preservatives,
the nature and quantity of such additions
is settled by Act of Parliament. Many foods are
preserved with small quantities of Borax or Boric
Acid. The use of Formaldehyde, formerly sold
under the German trade name of Formalin, is not
unknown but it is very injurious. Salicylic Acid
which was formerly much used is being supplanted
by Benzoic Acid, for the reason that the latter is not
so easily detected and therefore prosecution for
excessive quantities is not so likely to follow. These
preservatives are not easily detected by the microscopist
unless he be a chemist also.</p>

<p>As we have already remarked adulterants are
added for the sake of colour, either because the
public demand certain colours, or to hide fraud.
Milk for instance, when watered, assumes a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
blue colour; to hide the blue shade various
dyes, anetto, turmeric or carrot juice are added or
one of the aniline dyes, products of coal tar. This
form of deception became so common that now the
public demand yellow milk and butter. Jams made
from inferior or over-ripe fruit are frequently
coloured with coal tar dyes, so also are cheap sweets.
Oxide of iron is added to potted meats, sauces, etc.,
to improve their appearance. Bottled peas, which
if untreated would be of a yellowish-green colour,
are made to appear bright green by the addition
of the poisonous blue vitriol; fortunately this chemical
unites with the chlorophyll of the peas to form
a compound which is insoluble in the human body
and so no great harm is done. We may compare
the chlorophyll in a healthy, undoctored green pea
with that in a pea which has been treated with blue
vitriol; under the microscope we shall notice the
striking difference between the two.</p>

<p>When we admire the beautiful crystals which go
to the making of a piece of lump sugar we little
dream that, if those crystals were pure they would
be yellow. The housewife, however, demands her
lump sugar white so ultramarine is added to mask
the yellow colour and give the sugar its white
appearance.</p>

<p>Most of these impurities are difficult or impossible
of detection under the microscope; they are added
to give the food a more pleasing appearance in the
first place, for there are undoubtedly certain people
who prefer to consume food which appeals to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
eye, though of doubtful purity, rather than unadulterated
though perfectly pure fare. When
added solely for the sake of appearance it matters
little, but the habit of making these additions is
frequently cultivated to hide bad material and
imperfections in manufacture.</p>

<p>Sometimes adulterants find their way by accident
into our food. A good many years ago numbers of
people were poisoned by drinking beer, in some
cases with fatal results. Tests were made and the
beer was found to contain arsenic but how it got
there remained a mystery. At length the glucose,
a kind of sugar used in making beer and added also
to a good many of our foods, was found to contain
the substance. Now in the making of glucose, sulphuric
acid is used and in this particular case the
impure or commercial acid had been taken. This
impure acid frequently contains arsenic and, in the
case we mention, the results of its use were
disastrous.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smallfont">BACTERIA</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">There is probably no scientific work more
wedded to the microscope than the study
of bacteria. We may learn a great deal
about birds or insects or rocks or minerals, without
any instrument but we can learn little of the bacteria
unless they are highly magnified.</p>

<p>There is such an extraordinary amount of misconception
concerning bacteria that, it will be time
well spent if we attempt to clear up all misunderstanding
at the start. Bacteria, often called
microbes or germs, are looked upon with considerable
awe by most people, who associate them in
some vague way with disease. There is no denying
that many bacteria are responsible for certain
diseases; many more are perfectly harmless and
a goodly number are exceedingly useful.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the bacterial activities would
require a large book but briefly, apart from the
disease-causing bacteria, they enter into the manufacture
of cheese and butter, of wine and vinegar;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
they are essential to brewing and tanning; they
act as scavengers over the face of the earth, breaking
up a mass of decaying animal and vegetable
matter into simple chemical substances which can
then be used again as food for plants; some of
them also can take a gas called nitrogen, from the
air, and pass it on to green plants.</p>

<p>What are these active little creatures? The
question is a natural one. They are merely very
minute, one-celled plants. Each one possesses a
firm cell-wall, filled with living matter; in an
earlier chapter, we described the one called protean
animalcule and, although it was composed of but
a single cell it had no definite wall. This is one of
the essential differences between plants and animals,
both of them are made up of one or more, maybe
millions of cells, but each plant cell is surrounded
by a well-defined wall, animal cells have no such
walls. The exact position of the bacteria in the
plant world is still open to doubt. Most scientists
place them amongst the fungi; for, with very few
exceptions they possess no chlorophyll. One or two
of them, however, do possess a green colouring
matter which, if not chlorophyll is very near to it;
on this account other scientists are of the opinion
that they are related to the seaweeds. It is a
matter, however, that does not concern us very
deeply, for our purpose it is sufficient to know that
they are plants. When they were discovered, nearly
three hundred and twenty-five years ago, they were
looked upon as minute animals and it is curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that the belief has survived this long period of time
in the popular mind. Long before the activities of
bacteria were connected with various phenomena,
such as infectious diseases, souring of milk, etc., it
was thought that these changes were brought about
by chemical action. Like many of the early theories,
this one contained a half truth, for a great many
of the changes brought about by bacteria are really
due to chemical action initiated by the organisms.
In other words, the bacteria set free certain substances
which actually cause the changes to take
place.</p>

<p>Let us make our statement clear by a simple
experiment. To a little fresh milk we add a weak
acid, the milk curdles at once and by dipping a
piece of litmus paper (obtained at any chemist&#8217;s)
into the mixture, it will turn red, showing the
presence of acid. Litmus, by the way, is obtained
from a lichen; in the presence of acid it is red,
an alkali, the opposite of an acid, turns it blue. In
a neutral solution, that is to say one that is neither
acid nor alkaline, litmus is of a purplish hue.</p>

<p>To continue our experiment, we allow another
sample of the same milk to stand for a day or two
in a warm, dark place and again the milk will be
curdled. A test with the litmus will show that the
solution is acid. The bacteria themselves have not
curdled the milk but they have liberated a substance,
called a ferment, which has split up part
of the milk into an acid, amongst other things and
that acid has actually done the curdling. For this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
reason, weak alkalies are sometimes added to milk.
Acids and alkalies, of equal strength form neutral
solutions, so that, when the milk bacteria begin
their activities which result in the formation of acid,
it is at once made neutral by the alkali. By this
means, curdling is postponed for a little while,
though there comes a time, of course, when all the
alkali is used up, then the acid gains the upper hand
and curdling takes place. We could if we wished
continue adding more and more alkali to keep pace
with the formation of acid, but too much alkali
would be as unpalatable as too much acid, so
nothing would be gained.</p>

<p>Before we bring out our microscope to examine
these lowly plants, we will first of all kill a myth
which has survived, in the non-scientific mind, since
the eighteenth century and then describe briefly the
life history of a typical bacterium. Now for the
myth. Bacteria are so minute, their activities so
great and the results of their activities so far reaching,
that it is hardly surprising to learn that, even
at the present day, bacteria are supposed simply
&#8220;to happen.&#8221; We talk of thunder turning milk
sour, but thunder can no more sour milk than can
a passing train or an air raid or a burst in a water
main. True, milk turns sour more quickly in
thundery weather than in frosty weather, because,
when thunder threatens, the air is warm and the
milk-souring bacteria increase more rapidly in warm
weather than in cold. We must remember always
that bacteria are living beings and in common with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
all other living things they must have parents.
What probably took place at the beginning of the
world we cannot consider here but one thing is certain
that, at the present day, no living matter is produced
from non-living matter; &#8220;life from life&#8221; is
the only theory that will stand scientific tests and
this has been the case ever since the simplest microscopes
were thought of and thousands of years
before that. Any substance, however liable to
decay, if rendered germ free and kept germ free,
will retain its fresh condition indefinitely. Could
bacteria or germs, call them what you will, simply
happen it would be useless attempting to fight
against them.</p>

<p>Bacteria are everywhere. In the water we drink,
in the milk, butter, cheese and in dust. We cannot
avoid them, try as we will; it is fortunate, therefore,
that the majority are harmless. You may be
surprised that, with this ubiquity, you have never
seen one. When, however, you learn that most of
them are only about twenty-five thousandths of an
inch long and that a thousand million of them could
be packed comfortably into a little box, whose sides
measured but a twenty-fifth of an inch in length,
it is not really so surprising after all. Being so
small, the activities of a single bacterium are insignificant;
that &#8220;union is strength&#8221; was never
better exemplified than amongst these lowly plants.
There are no male and female bacteria, in the
majority of cases they increase by splitting, in fact
they are often called splitting plants. The change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
may be watched under the microscope. The plant
elongates somewhat, it becomes narrower and
narrower in the middle, it develops a waist in fact;
finally the two halves part company and each one
leads a separate existence as a bacterium. This
splitting progresses at an extraordinary rate. A
celebrated scientist once wrote: &#8220;Let us assume
that a microbe divides into two within an hour,
these two into four in the next hour, these again
into eight in the third hour and so on. The number
of microbes thus produced in 24 hours would exceed
<span class="nowrap">16 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> millions; in two days they would increase
to 47 trillions, and in a week the number expressing
them would be made up of 51 figures. At the end
of a day (24 hours) the microbes descended from
a single individual would occupy one fortieth of a
hollow cube with edges one twenty-fifth of an inch
long, but at the end of the following day would
fill a space of twenty-seven cubic inches, and in less
than five days their volume would equal that of the
ocean.&#8221; It is hardly necessary to add that these
alarming figures represent what would happen if no
accident befell the bacteria, they show the enormous
vitality possessed by the smallest of all plants.
Even allowing for misadventure their increase is
alarming; actual tests, with a sample of milk containing
originally 153,000 bacteria per cubic inch,
show that the cubic inch contained after one hour,
539,750; after two hours, 616,250; after seven hours,
1,020,000; after nine hours 2,040,000 and after
25 hours 85,000,000 individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer whom we have just quoted calculated
that a single bacterium weighs about
0.000,000,000,024,243,672 of a grain, that forty
thousand millions weigh one grain and that two
hundred and eighty-nine billions weigh a pound.
The descendants of one bacterium weigh <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2666</span> of
a grain, after twenty-four hours; more than a pound
after two days, and sixteen and a half million pounds
after three days. The assumption in this case, also,
is that no harm comes to any of them; the mortality
amongst bacteria is, clearly, very great.</p>

<p>Sometimes, owing to external conditions, such as
lack of food certain bacteria produce spores. The
power of spore formation is not possessed by all
bacteria and those which are able to bring it about
are difficult to kill for the spores, which contain
the living material of the bacterium are surrounded
with walls which will resist boiling, drying, freezing
and all manner of ill treatment. The spore formation
of bacteria is very simple, all or part of the
living contents of the bacterium becomes surrounded
by a tough wall and remains so surrounded till circumstances
are favourable, when the wall bursts,
its contents escapes and becomes a bacterium, capable
of founding a new colony by the method of
splitting we have already described.</p>

<p>Now let us try to find out what sort of plants
we are to look for, when we are searching for
bacteria, under our microscope. They exist in many
forms, to which special names have been applied,
and it is unfortunate that, very often, their external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
form varies according to their state, thus a bacterium
may be spherical when young and rod shaped
when older. Some bacteria are spherical and are
known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cocci</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Micrococci</i>, from Greek words
meaning a berry or a little berry respectively;
sometimes these spherical bacteria occur in pairs,
then they are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diplococci</i> (double berries); or
in chains, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Streptococci</i> (chain berries); or in
bunches, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Staphylococci</i> (grape berries). They may
resemble short rods, when they are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacteria</i>,
a name, by the way, which is also applied generally
to all microbes; they may, on the other hand, have
the appearance of longer rods and then they are
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacilli</i>. Some of these longer rods may be
curved or even corkscrew shaped when they are
known by the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirilla</i>. Rather fearsome
names some of these we fear and we wished to
avoid long names, but they appear over and over
again in books and papers relating to bacteria so
we are compelled to introduce them to our pages.
Many bacteria possess no power of movement, others
swim rapidly, by the aid of the lashing movement
of little whip-like structures with which they are
furnished.</p>

<p>After all this preamble, which we hope has cleared
up certain misconceptions regarding bacteria and
has given the reader some insight into their habits,
we may proceed to the examination of some of the
plants themselves. At the outset we have a confession
to make. Bacteria can only be studied
seriously, by those who possess very expensive and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
elaborate apparatus; considerable technical skill is
required to prepare the plants for examination&mdash;many
of them indeed can only be seen after they
have been stained and lastly, to trifle with the
disease-causing members of the family may lead to
dangerous if not fatal results.</p>

<p>Having issued our warning let us see what we can
do in the way of microscopic investigation. The
easiest subject with which to make a start is the
Hay Bacillus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacillus Subtilis</i>, not because it is the
largest of the bacteria by any means, but because
it is very easily obtained. Each plant measures
about five thousandths of an inch in length, so we
shall require a high magnification to examine it.
Having obtained a small quantity of hay, we must
boil it in water for about three-quarters of an hour
and then set it aside for some hours. In due course
the water will contain hundreds upon hundreds of
bacteria or, speaking more correctly, of bacilli. For
our work, we shall require a special kind of microscope
slide; instead of the piece of plain glass we
have been accustomed to use we must obtain one
with a circular portion, hollowed out from the
centre. Having done so, we take a clean glass rod
and, with it, transfer a drop of the water, containing
the bacilli, to the centre of a clean coverslip.
Invert the coverslip so that the drop is on
the lower surface and place it over the hollow
portion of the slide, in such a manner that the drop
still remains suspended from the coverslip; this is
known as the hanging-drop method and requires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
some little skill to accomplish satisfactorily. When
our slide is prepared, with a magnification of at
least one thousand diameters, we may reasonably
hope that our trouble will be rewarded.</p>

<p>At first we shall probably see nothing. We recall
that we had some difficulty in examining starch
grains, on account of the fact that they were colourless.
This time we are dealing with a far more
difficult subject. When our eyes become accustomed
to the light, however, we shall be conscious
that there is something moving in our drop of water.
The Hay Bacillus is one of the moving forms, each
individual is furnished with a number of little whips
whose lashings enable it to travel through the water.
The whips cannot be seen in unstained bacilli;
experience, however, tells us that they are there,
for all these lowly plants which show movement are
seen when stained, to possess the little whips. The
process of staining kills the plants so that we cannot
see the little whips in action.</p>

<p>Having detected that movement is taking place,
a little adjustment of focus and a further search
will reveal the bacilli to us, as little rod-like, colourless
individuals. We shall see their cell contents if
they are sufficiently highly magnified and also their
cell walls. We may even observe them splitting,
each one into two individuals. We must keep our
sample of water for later examination. In fact, we
may examine drops from day to day, in exactly
the same manner. After a short lapse of time we
shall notice that the bacteria have increased to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
alarming extent and also that they no longer swim
about. At this period they tend to arrange
themselves in chains lengthwise, their cell walls also
lose their clear cut appearance and become jelly like,
yet withal they may still continue to split up.</p>

<p>If we now examine the water from which we
have taken our drop we shall probably find a scum
floating on the surface; it consists of millions upon
millions of hay bacilli, huddled together so to speak.
It is the beginning of the end for them, nourishment
is becoming scarce and important changes are about
to take place. Let us continue our examination
day by day, that we may discover what is happening.
Before long, we shall find that within each
cell wall, which is no longer jelly like, there is a
darker cell contents than we saw before. The
bacilli have, in fact, formed spores. Now we may
plug our bottle containing the remainder of the
water, with cotton wool and set it aside for some
months if we wish. At the end of that time, by
pouring a fresh supply of water upon the spores,
we may start them all into a new vitality and the
whole process will be repeated.</p>

<p>We have mentioned that bacteria should be
stained, in order to make their presence more easily
detected. This is hardly the place to enter into
a lengthy discussion concerning the methods of
staining but, for the benefit of our readers, who
wish to pursue the subject further, we will state
as concisely as possible how simple staining may
be accomplished. Our requirements are, a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Cornet&#8217;s forceps, two small bottles of stain, say
Carbol-Fuchsin and Methylene Blue and a larger
bottle of <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> per cent. Acetic acid; these may be
obtained from the firm who supplied our microscope
and, for the beginner at anyrate, it is cheaper
to buy the solutions ready made, than to attempt
to make them up at home. Slides and cover slips,
we require, of course, and they must be absolutely
grease proof; it may be necessary to boil them in
a strong solution of caustic soda to effect this
result. A small bottle of Canada Balsam completes
our requirements.</p>

<p>Should we wish to examine a drop of milk for
bacteria, we proceed in this manner. With the aid
of the Cornet&#8217;s forceps pick up two cover slips, place
a drop of milk on one and cover with the other.
With thumb and finger bring the glasses into close
contact, so that the milk forms a thin film. Slide
one glass from the other and set aside, milk side
upwards, till dry. Next take each cover slip,
separately, in the forceps and pass rapidly two or
three times through the flame of a spirit lamp, this
fixes the bacteria, if any be present, to the glass.
Now having poured a little of the stain, say methylene
blue, into a shallow vessel, a saucer will do,
we place our cover slips therein for two minutes or
so. Then, remove them with the forceps, wash in
water till no more stain comes away and set aside
to dry. When dry, take a clean slide, place a small
drop of Canada Balsam at its centre and gently
lower the cover slip thereon, stained side downwards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
If we now examine our slide under a high
magnification, we shall easily be able to see whether
bacteria are present or not. Should our preparation
be too deeply stained, a good slide will show the
bacteria stained blue against an almost colourless
background, we must immerse our second preparation
for a few moments in a little of the <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> per cent.
acetic acid which will have the effect of removing
the excess of stain; then, after washing and drying,
we proceed as before.</p>

<p>Beautiful double staining may be performed by
the following method. In addition to the chemicals
we already possess we shall require some 5 per cent.
acetic acid. Double staining is especially useful for
spore-forming bacteria, so we may take some of the
Hay Bacillus at sporing time. Proceed exactly as
described above substituting, of course, a drop of
water known to contain the bacilli for the drop of
milk. When the two cover slips are ready for
staining, warm some of the Carbol-Fuchsin in a
saucer and leave the cover slip therein for five
minutes, then transfer to a 5 per cent. solution of
Acetic Acid till all the stain appears to be removed,
afterwards wash in water. The cover slips must
next be immersed for a few minutes, two should be
long enough, in Methylene blue solution, then
washed and, when dry, mounted on a slide with
Canada Balsam, as described above. If the staining
has been properly carried out, we shall have
a most beautiful preparation, showing spores stained
red and the rest of the bacilli blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The work that may be done with bacteria is
limitless but, to advance very far, we shall need
facilities for obtaining what are known as &#8220;pure
cultures.&#8221; Let us make the term clear. Suppose
we take milk, water, butter, anything in fact upon
which bacteria will grow and examine them carefully.
If we have the requisite knowledge and
recognise what we see, we shall find not one kind
of bacterium but a number of different bacteria.
Now by certain manipulations, which need not be
described here, all the different kinds of bacteria
may be sorted out, so that we have colonies consisting
of one kind of bacterium only and such a
colony is known as a &#8220;pure culture.&#8221;</p>

<p>In practice, bacteriologists do not use the rough
and ready methods that we used in dealing with
the Hay Bacillus. They prepare pure cultures and
cultivate the bacteria on various substances, differing
markedly from those on which they originally
lived. For example, a jelly-like substance, mainly
composed of beef broth and gelatine is one of the
favourite substances on which to grow bacteria,
milk is also used in some cases and also slices of
potato. All this may seem to have little to do with
the microscope, but indeed the bacteriologist relies
as much on the behaviour of his pure cultures,
growing on gelatine, etc., as on their appearance
under the microscope. Some bacteria will not grow
on the surface of the gelatine but only in the body of
the substance, where air cannot reach them; others
cause the gelatine to become liquid; others give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
off a characteristic smell or impart a well-marked
colour to their food material; a few even cause the
gelatine to become luminous. These easily seen
characters are quite as typical of the various
bacteria which bring them about as are the microscopic
characters; in fact it sometimes happens
that only by a combination of the two is it possible
to be certain of what one has obtained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smallfont">MEDICAL WORK WITH THE MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">To the medical man, a microscope is all
important. In the first place it is absolutely
necessary for him to have an accurate
knowledge of the human body; he must be able
to recognise healthy blood, he must know the
varied cells composing muscle and bone, etc. Then
again the medical aspect of bacteriology is all important;
we have devoted a <a href="#Page_152">separate chapter to
bacteria</a> and there we warned our readers not to
look upon all bacteria as harmful, nevertheless, the
harmful ones are all important in medical work.</p>

<p>Of recent years a knowledge of the structure and
habits of certain insects has become an important
branch of medicine for many of these creatures carry
diseases from one patient to another. This branch
of medicine is more important in the tropics than
in this country, for most of the really harmful
insects live in warm countries.</p>

<p>A number of lowly animals claim attention from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the medical man for they are parasites of the human
body; many fungi, too, cause disease. A certain
amount of chemical work with the microscope also
falls to the lot of the medical man.</p>

<p>We have stated many times in our pages that,
both plants and animals, are made up of one or
more cells and that the cells of plants are each
surrounded by a more or less rigid cell wall, whilst
those of animals have no definite cell wall. As a
start in our medical investigations we may examine
some cells from our own person. There is no need
for alarm, the operation is quite painless. After
having prepared our microscope and got ready a
clean slide, on which we place a drop of clean water,
we must take some clean, blunt instrument such
as a tooth-brush handle and gently scrape the inside
of the cheek. Having done so, dip the part of the
tooth-brush with which the scraping has been done,
in the drop of water, then cover the water with a
cover slip.</p>

<p>A careful examination of our object with a fairly
high magnification will show that, though the
scraping was very gentle and quite painless, something
has been removed from the mouth. We shall
see a number of cells, somewhat overlapping like
the tiles of a roof. They are almost colourless, and
have ill-defined margins, certainly no cell wall, and
each cell contains a dark spot near its centre. These
cells from our own person will give us a good idea
of the appearance of animal cells, for we are animals,
much as we may dislike the idea. The dark spot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in the middle of each cell is called a nucleus, it is
the most active part of the cell and when the latter
is about to divide, as it does when growth takes
place, the nucleus always divides first.</p>

<div id="Fig_168" class="figcenter" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/i_168fp.jpg" width="293" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">1. <span class="smcap">Crystals from Human Blood</span></p>

<p class="captiontextcenter">It is often possible to identify the source of blood by means of crystals which
can be obtained from it, for each race of animal has its own special form of blood
crystal. The large crystal at the margin exhibits the typical shape.</p>

<p class="center">2. <span class="smcap">Crystals from the Blood of the Baboon</span></p>

<p class="captiontextcenter">These show some resemblance to human blood.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Now we may perform another operation upon
ourselves, rather more painful than the last one but
not very serious. We wish to examine some human
blood, so we tie a handkerchief tightly round one
of our fingers and with a clean needle&mdash;be sure that
it is clean&mdash;make a puncture in the finger tip. The
handkerchief bandage will prevent our feeling any
pain. We must put the drop of blood we have
obtained in the centre of a clean slide and examine
it under the microscope. While the blood is still
liquid, we shall see a number of circular discs
floating about, they are very small being only <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3200</span>
inch in diameter. The centre of each disc appears
darker than the rim, but this darker shade is only
apparent. Using a term we introduced in our
chapter on the lens, we may call the discs double
concave. Now let us watch our objects for a
moment and we shall notice that they begin to
arrange themselves in chains, they appear like a
number of draughtsmen placed one upon the other,
our drop of blood is now beginning to clot. A simple
experiment may be attempted at this stage; we
must run a drop of water on to our little blood
discs and watch carefully what happens. We shall
see that they change their shape gradually, from
being double concave they become flat sided, and
this is not all, for they continue to change till both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sides bulge outwards and they may be described as
double convex.</p>

<p>These little discs are known as red blood corpuscles.
Their shape is some indication of the
animal to which they belong; those of man, as we
have seen, are circular and so are those of most
of the higher animals, except the camel tribe, which
has oval, red blood corpuscles. Birds, reptiles and
fishes have corpuscles agreeing in shape with those
of the camel. In size there is a great deal of
difference between the corpuscles of various animals;
a member of the deer family has the smallest and
a creature related to our Newts, called Proteus, has
the largest. The size of the blood corpuscles bears
no relation to the size of the animal to which they
belong, those of the frog measure <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">1108</span> inch, or
nearly three times the size of the red blood corpuscles
of man. Without much difficulty it should
be possible to obtain other samples of blood and the
red corpuscles should always be examined, needless
to say the blood should always be in a fresh condition.
In addition to the red corpuscles we may
notice a few smaller circular bodies, they are the
white corpuscles. If we have any difficulty in finding
them in our own blood, we can examine another
specimen of frog&#8217;s blood, in which they are more
easily seen. It has been calculated that in a cubic
inch of blood from a healthy human being there
are eighty millions of red and a quarter of a million
of white blood corpuscles. Although there is such
an enormous difference in the sizes of red corpuscles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
from various animals, the white corpuscles are
remarkably constant, measuring about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3000</span> inch
in warm-blooded animals and <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2500</span> inch in reptiles.
Sometimes, as we are examining the white
blood corpuscles under the microscope, we shall
notice that they behave in a similar manner to the
Proteus Animalcule, which we described in our
<a href="#Page_66">chapter on Pond Life</a>. A kind of creeping motion
takes place and the corpuscle loses its circular shape.
In our own blood this movement lasts but a very
few moments, in frogs&#8217; blood, by keeping our slide
moderately warm, we may witness the movement
for some time.</p>

<p>It is perfectly easy to watch the circulation of
blood in the foot of a frog. For this purpose we
require a piece of apparatus known as a frog plate,
this is merely a flat brass plate perforated with
a number of holes, through which tape is passed
to bind the frog down and having also a hole the
size of the opening in the microscope stage, into
which a circle of glass is usually fitted. Such a plate
may be made of wood and will serve our purpose
quite as well as the more expensive brass plate.
We must bind our frog firmly, but not too tightly
with wet rag, leaving one leg exposed. This free
leg must now be fastened in such a manner that
one of the webs between its toes comes over the
opening in the plate, finally the toes must be carefully
tied with string so that they remain apart and
the web is fully expanded. Having fixed our frog
in a satisfactory position let us examine his blood-vessels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
under a fairly high power. We shall find
that there are large and small vessels in his webbed
foot; we will devote our observation to the small
vessels, called capillaries, from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capillus</i>,
a hair, because of their small size. Probably the
blood will not flow when we make our first examination
and this points to one of two things, either
the frog is bound too tightly or he has not recovered
from the alarm he experienced at his treatment.
In the latter event he will not be long recovering
and his blood circulation will soon be in full working
order; in the former case, we must loosen his
bandages. In some of the very small blood-vessels
we shall notice that the blood always flows in one
direction, in others it does not appear to have any
definite direction. In either case, however, we can
see the red corpuscles flowing rapidly along the
central stream of the blood-vessel whilst the white
corpuscles travel much more slowly along the sides.</p>

<p>The medical man may be called upon to decide
two questions concerning human blood; he may
wish to know whether it is healthy and, in the case
of certain crimes, he must be able to state positively
whether certain stains are caused by human blood
or not. Dealing with these questions in order, let
us see how we would proceed. There are many
people, far too many in towns who are described
as bloodless, the expression is of course an exaggeration
for no bloodless person could continue to
exist. What really happens is that such people are
deficient in red blood corpuscles. If we examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
two samples of blood, one from a perfectly healthy
subject and one from a so-called bloodless subject
we shall probably not be able to detect any difference
between the two, but the experienced medical
man will soon see that one sample has too few red
blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>An unhealthy state of the blood is often indicated
by the shape of the blood crystals. Let us see how
we may obtain some of these crystals. If we add a
drop of ether to our drop of blood upon the slide, and
wait a few moments till the ether has evaporated,
we shall notice when we examine our object again,
under a high magnification, that a number of
prismatic crystals have formed, especially towards
the edges of the slide. Now in certain diseases of
the blood, these crystals are no longer formed in
their usual shape, thus pointing out to the medical
man that something is amiss. Again there are many
blood parasites just as there are external parasites
of man. In the disease known as malaria, very
small parasites are introduced into the blood by
mosquitoes. Each of these little parasites enters
a red blood corpuscle, divides up into many smaller
individuals, causes the corpuscles to burst, then
each little parasite attacks more corpuscles. Some
of these little bodies are sucked up, along with the
blood of malaria patients, by other mosquitoes and,
if the insects are of the particular kind which spread
malaria, the parasites complete their development
within the mosquito. Patients suffering from that
terrible African malady known as sleeping sickness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have blood parasites resembling minute eels with
long threadlike tails. These parasites are the cause
of the malady and are introduced into the blood by
flies, closely related to house flies. There are a very
large number of blood parasites of one kind and
another, so it is clear that a knowledge of blood is
very important to the medical man.</p>

<p>From our remarks concerning the sizes of the red
corpuscles in the blood of man and various animals,
one might be excused from thinking that it would
be quite easy for anyone with a little experience
to recognise human blood. As a matter of fact it
is very difficult, it is always a doubtful matter to
rely upon size alone. We have mentioned blood
crystals and these give us a slightly better clue to
the origin of the blood, for the blood crystals of
different animals vary in shape, far more than their
corpuscles. Those of the guinea-pig, for example,
are little four sided pyramids; those of the mouse,
eight sided and so on. Some apes, however, have
blood crystals very similar to those of man, so
similar that the two may be confused. The microscopist
who is compelled to give an opinion concerning
the origin of a sample of blood, especially
blood which is some days old, is faced with no light
task.</p>

<p>Without the assistance of the microscope, medical
men would never have discovered the cause of
many of these insect-borne diseases, they could
never have traced the development of the blood
parasites in the bodies of insects. For many years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
it was thought that the disease malaria was caused
by the damp air of low-lying land, in fact the word
malaria is derived from two Italian words meaning
bad air. It was not till the advent of the microscope
that the true cause of the disease was learned
and the discovery was made that the only connection
between the malady and dampness is that the
mosquitoes which carry the disease can only thrive
in damp situations.</p>

<p>Medical work with the microscope also entails a
study of external and internal parasites of man
other than those which infest the blood. Some of
the larger human parasites we know only too
well, they force their unpleasant attentions upon
us from time to time, but fortunately they are not
as a rule serious and are soon got rid of. The
cleanest of us, in these days of universal travel,
cannot avoid the visitations of the lively flea, he
is at worst an annoying companion, but he has a
cousin who is responsible for the passing of the
germs of the dreaded plague from rats to man.
Plague long remained a mystery, which, without
the help of the microscope, would probably have
remained unsolved to this day. Many of these
apparently harmless blood-sucking insects may
prove to be disease carriers, as medical knowledge
and microscopic investigation is brought to bear
upon them.</p>

<p>The majority of the smaller external parasites are
beyond the reach of the amateur microscopist. A
number of course are available to medical students,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
but we write for the ordinary enthusiast and not
for the specialist. Many interesting little mites,
closely allied to the cheese-mites, cause skin diseases
and the creatures themselves as well as their tunnels
in the skin are interesting.</p>

<p>There is one little parasite which we nearly all
of us carry without knowing it, and it makes quite
an interesting object for the microscope. Its name
is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Demodex Folliculorum</i> and it dwells in the sweat
glands, especially those round about the nose. It
is very minute and requires a high magnification
for its examination. The adult is worm-like and
tapering in the hinder two-thirds of its body, whilst
the front third, to which is attached four pairs of
short, fleshy legs, is stouter. From the eggs which
may be heart or spindle shaped, little six-legged
grubs arise; later these grubs change into the eight-legged
adults. All the changes take place in the
sweat glands, and the creatures live with their heads
turned away from the gore of the gland.</p>

<p>To observe these strange little creatures it is only
necessary to squeeze some of the white congealed
perspiration from one of these glands on to a slide,
coyer it with a drop of oil or xylol and spread out
the object with a needle. By cutting down the light
considerably by means of the diaphragm, we shall
be able to distinguish all the stages of these little
creatures which, unbidden, share our lives.</p>

<p>Other parasites come to us in our food and, of
these, one of the most dangerous is known as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichinella Spiralis</i> and gives rise to a disease known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as trichinosis. We need not give a precise account
of the life history of this interesting worm, it will
suffice for our purpose to know that it finds its way
into the bodies of human beings, in badly cooked
pork or in improperly cured ham or bacon. The
little worm is only about <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">25</span> inch long and, at
first, dwells in the intestines of the pig. Each
female produces upwards of fifteen thousand young
and these pass into the blood of their host and thence
to its muscles. Snugly coiled into a spiral between
the muscle fibres, each young worm becomes surrounded
with a lemon-shaped covering, which is
exceedingly resistant. Suppose now a human being
should happen to eat such pork, the juices of the
stomach would dissolve the pork and also the little
case enclosing the parasite. Once set free in the
human body, the whole proceeding is repeated and,
at last, the result is very severe muscular pains
for the victim. The medical man is called upon to
study such parasites as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichinella</i>, and they are
not so uncommon as one might think.</p>

<p>In addition to animal parasites medical science
demands a knowledge of many disease bringing
fungi. One of the commonest is the fungus responsible
for the unpleasant malady called ringworm.
But we have written sufficient to show that the
general practitioner needs his microscope always by
his side. Not only so but very many instruments
he uses in his work, though called by other names,
are really microscopes adapted for special purposes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE AND AGRICULTURE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Probably there are not many farmers
who use a microscope and fewer still who
use one to help them in their business,
yet there are few people to whom one of these
instruments would be more useful. Their seeds
are often far from pure and the microscope will
reveal the impurities which may consist of dirt
and dust, or of other seeds, seeds which will
grow into weeds and make the crop less valuable
or, if present in large quantities, render it valueless.
Agricultural plants become attacked by varied
diseases which can only be studied under the
microscope; insects also do their share of destruction
and much may be learned about them when
they are magnified. Fungi and insects not only
attack crops but domestic animals as well. The
microscope is an invaluable aid in studying the soil,
in dairy work and in many other ways closely
connected with agriculture.</p>

<p>That the testing of agricultural seeds is very
important is shown by the fact that not very long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ago a deputation urged the Government to establish
a National Seed Testing Station; no further plans
have been made, however. Seed testing is very
interesting work, every seed has its particular shape
and markings and the student soon becomes absorbed
in seeking for weed seeds among the collections
he examines. A weed in the sense we use
it here is not necessarily a harmful plant, it is a
plant in the wrong place. For example a carrot
growing in a field of turnips, though a useful plant
would be a weed. When the farmer sowed turnip
seed he did not do so with the object of raising
carrots.</p>

<p>The only apparatus necessary for the study of
most farm seeds is a powerful magnifying glass,
one that will enlarge the seeds ten diameters or
more. When beginning this work, a difficulty
occurs at once for, without assistance from an
expert, it is by no means easy to learn the names
of the seeds one examines. The difficulty can be
overcome to a certain extent if we know the names
of flowers, for then we can collect the seeds from
these flowers and we shall have properly named
specimens as a guide. Beginning in this way, we
shall soon find that the seeds can be arranged in
groups and there will then be no difficulty in
recognising say clover seed or grass seed, though
much more experience will be necessary before we
can say to which kind of clover or grass the seed
belongs.</p>

<p>Many of these seeds are well worth studying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
whether we are interested in seed testing or not.
The corn buttercup and the wild carrot have curious
spined seeds; those of the larkspur when magnified
appear to be studded with little shreds of paper.
White and red campion, have kidney shaped seeds
studded with warts and so similar to one another
that the microscopist who can distinguish one from
the other may consider himself something of an
expert. Spurrey has lens shaped seeds with raised
equator-like rims. Evening primrose seeds are
curious because they are found in all sorts of shapes.
The seeds of rib-wort plantain resemble miniature
date seeds, others resemble minute bananas, some
are perfectly round, others almost square; some
have smooth shining surfaces which look as though
they had been artificially polished, others again are
wrinkled and deeply furrowed; but, most curious
of all the common seeds are those of the cornflower,
they resemble nothing so much as little shaving-brushes,
with bright yellow bristles. Many profitable
hours may be spent in studying the seeds of
our common native plants, both wild and cultivated.</p>

<p>There are two specially obnoxious plants whose
seeds may be mixed with agricultural seed, to the
dismay of the farmer. We refer to Broomrape and
Dodder, both of them unable to earn their own
living and depending for their existence on the
robbing of other plants. Broomrape usually attaches
itself to the roots of Hazel, Poplar or Beech
and steals its food therefrom, but its fleshy pink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
stems and flowers may sometimes be seen in clover
fields, then clover is its victim.</p>

<p>More common and more destructive is the little
Dodder, a member of the Convolvulus family. Its
seeds are very minute and when they germinate
they give rise to a seedling not unlike a piece of
wire. With one end fixed in the ground, the other
waves about till it finds a clover plant round which
it twines and not only so but it sends out suckers
which microscopic examination shows, penetrate
the stem of the clover to rob its food. By pulling
a Dodder stem away from the clover we can clearly
see a number of holes where the suckers have
entered.</p>

<p>Fungus diseases and insects wage constant warfare
on the farmer&#8217;s belongings. That we may
better understand the structure of the disease-causing
fungi we are about to examine, let us
refresh our memories concerning that very common
fungus, known as white mould and mentioned in
an earlier chapter. The reason fungi cause damage
to other plants, the one invariable reason, is that
they, being unable to manufacture food for themselves,
steal it from the plants on which they grow.
Some of them are parasites and steal their food from
living animals or plants; others live upon dead
animal or vegetable matter and the white mould
is one of the latter fungi.</p>

<p>In most of the fungi which concern us we shall
find that there is a mass of minute, thread-like
structures forming the main body of the fungus and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that, here and there, portions grow erect and bear
spores. The spores, it is important to remember,
serve the same purpose to the fungus as seeds to
the flowering plants. They are blown or carried
by insects or other agencies to suitable situations
for growth, they germinate and form new fungi.
They are smaller and lighter than the most minute
and dust-like seeds, so that the slightest breeze
scatters them far and wide. Let us compare the
white mould with a mushroom; at first sight the
two plants appear very dissimilar, in reality they
are very similar to one another. The mould forms
a thick felt of its threads over the substance on
which it grows and mushroom spawn if carefully
examined under a microscope will be found to consist
of very similar threads, sealed together to form
thicker root-like structures. The fungi, however,
have no roots and these threads are strictly comparable
with those of the mould. Here and there
the mould sends a single thread into the air and
each of these threads is terminated by a little ball
which bursts eventually and sets free its contained
spores. The same thing occurs with the mushroom;
we have the upright growth, not of a single thread
it is true but of a number, welded together to form
a fleshy stalk; at the top there is, not a ball containing
spores but an umbrella-shaped structure
whose under surface is composed of a number of
&#8220;gills&#8221; on which the spores grow at the ends of
little stalks. If a piece of the mushroom stem be
torn into its separate components and examined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
under the microscope, its similarity to the more
simple fungus is evident. One of the gills also may
be carefully cut away and examined; the spores
will be seen at the end of small forked stalks.</p>

<p>Having progressed thus far in our study of
fungus structure, we may examine a few of those
which cause damage in farm and garden. For the
most part, the thread-like portion of the fungus
grows within the plant attacked and only the spore
bearing portions appear on the surface. There is
one class of fungus, however, the Mildews in which
practically all the structure grows on the surface,
only a few small, unbranched suckers penetrate the
plant attacked, for the purpose of obtaining
nourishment.</p>

<p>Though of great interest to the microscopist, the
potato disease is often the cause of serious loss to
the farmer. Not only potatoes but also tomatoes
are attacked. A potato plant suffering from the
disease has irregular yellowish or brownish spots
upon its leaves in the summertime. An examination
of the lower surface of one of these spotted
leaves will reveal a silvery white margin to each
spot. This portion should be magnified with a fairly
high power and care must be taken not to injure
the diseased part of the leaf before it is examined.
In cases of serious disease, from nearly every
pore on the surface of the leaf fungus threads will
be seen to issue. The threads are branched and, at
the end of each branch, they have a special kind
of spore. They look not unlike miniature leafless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
trees and they give the typical silvery white appearance
to the margins of the diseased spots. When
the spores of potato disease germinate, the young
fungus threads enter the leaf through a pore and
for sometime afterwards there is no sign that the
plant is diseased. On this account potato disease
and many other fungus diseases are rendered more
serious in that the farmer is not and cannot be
aware that his crop is attacked till the disease has
taken a firm hold. Eventually the potatoes themselves
become brown, rotten and breeding grounds
for bacteria.</p>

<p>A very common plant disease which makes a good
study for the microscope, may be found in quantity
upon shepherd&#8217;s purse, and as it also attacks cultivated
plants of the same family, cabbages, cauliflowers
and the like, it is of no little importance.
In its early stages, the fungus looks like patches
of thick white paint upon the plant and where the
fungus grows the plant is invariably contorted. As
the fungus matures, the skin of the diseased plant
splits and a white powder issues. If some of this
powder be highly magnified, it will be found to
consist of chains of spores, six or seven in a chain.
The spores break off singly and each one may start
the disease in another plant.</p>

<p>The microscopist who hunts in garden and farm
for fungus diseases, will assuredly meet with some
examples of that large class known as &#8220;smuts.&#8221;
They are so called on account of the black powder
with which the attacked portions of the plants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
become filled. The smuts are very important but
are not of much interest as objects for the microscope,
so we will pass them over for subjects of
greater interest if of less importance.</p>

<p>Every farmer knows the familiar and destructive
fungus known as &#8220;rust of wheat,&#8221; it is one of a
large class of most interesting plants. The &#8220;rusts&#8221;
are interesting to the microscopist on account of
their structure and to the botanist because they
cannot, like other fungi, complete their lives upon
one plant. They derive their popular name from the
fact that they look like patches of rust upon the
plants on which they live. Some of the greatest
living agricultural botanists have spent many years
on producing races of wheat upon which rust fungus
will not grow. Wonderful success has rewarded
their efforts and conferred immense benefits upon
farmers. In spite of this, however, we need not
despair that we shall be unable to find a specimen
for our microscope, though it is happily an undoubted
fact that the disease is not so common now
as a few years ago.</p>

</div>

<p>Rust of wheat fungus grows part of its time on
barberry leaves and part on wheat. In the summer,
if we examine one of the rust-like patches on stem
or leaf of wheat we shall see that it consists of a
dense bunch of small, short stalks each one of which
is terminated by an oblong red-brown spore. If we
keep another patch of the fungus under observation,
we shall find as the season advances, that
instead of the red-brown patch it has grown darker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and darker till it has become almost black. The
microscope will show us that the structure of the
spores has altered considerably. There is still the
same bunch of stalks but they have lengthened
somewhat and now each spore which terminates
each stalk is divided into two parts by a wall across
its narrow part. The walls surrounding the spores
also appear thicker, as indeed they are. These are
the winter spores, they fall to the ground eventually
and there they remain, unharmed by frost or snow
or rain, till the spring. In the spring they germinate
and give rise, not immediately to another
fungus, as might be expected, but to another kind
of spore. Curiously enough these new spring-formed
spores cannot grow upon wheat and unless they are
carried by wind or some other agency to a barberry
plant their existence is ended. Should they reach
a barberry leaf, however, they will germinate, penetrate
the leaf and grow for a period. Eventually
the fungus appears on the lower surface of the leaf
in beautiful structures called cluster cups. Under
the microscope, one of these cluster cups forms a
lovely object. The leaf skin is split and below the
ruptured skin may be seen a flask-shaped hollow
filled with chains of minute golden-yellow spores.
The spores break away, one by one and favoured
by fortune, are carried to a wheat plant where they
germinate and give rise to the familiar rust. Any
microscopist anxious for research has a life&#8217;s work
before him in tracing the histories of this one class
of fungi, should he feel inclined to shoulder the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
burden. Very many cluster cups are known and
very many rusts and all that is required is an
enthusiastic mycologist, as the student of fungi is
called, to put the pieces of the puzzle together, so
to speak. It is not so very many years ago that
the connection between the cluster cups of barberry
and the rust of wheat was quite unthought of.</p>

<p>We cannot afford much more space to plant
diseases, the farmer has other troubles and we must
mention some of them. We cannot leave the subject,
however, without a word concerning the mildews.
As we have mentioned, they are curious
because they dwell outside the plants they attack.
Rose mildew is unfortunately all too common in
every garden, it may be recognised as a white
powder covering leaves and buds. Under the microscope,
in the summer we shall find that it consists
of a number of thread-like structures, not unlike
those of the common white mould and that there
are a number of erect chains of spores. Towards
autumn, a further examination will show us many
round dark-brown structures from which project a
number of minute threads. These brown spheres
are the winter stage of the fungus, designed to withstand
inclement weather. In the spring, the spheres
burst and set free a number of minute sacs, each
one containing eight spores. The spores germinate
on rose leaves and start the disease anew.</p>

<p>There will be no difficulty in finding mildews;
they are all very similar to the rose mildew in
general but they all differ in detail. The gooseberry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
mildew for example, has a large number of threads
running from its winter spheres and each thread is
terminated by a little group of branches. The sacs
which fall from the opened sphere in the spring,
only contain four spores in this case.</p>

<p>The animal enemies of the farmer, so far as they
concern the microscopist are more difficult to study.
Many of them are internal parasites and to gain
a real knowledge of their habits and life histories
necessitates a good deal of rather unpleasant work
for which the ordinary microscopist has neither the
time nor the inclination.</p>

<p>In order to give our readers some idea of this
work, let us take one of the commonest of all agricultural
parasites and trace its life history whilst
giving hints for its examination under the microscope.
The common liver fluke is a worm which, in
the adult stage, frequents the liver of some domestic
animal, usually the sheep. A friendly butcher will
probably be able to supply us with a specimen and,
when we receive it, we shall probably dub it a very
unwormlike creature. The worms form a large
class in the animal kingdom and they do not
all resemble the earthworm by any manner of
means.</p>

<p>The liver fluke is a flat, almost leaf-like creature,
it is not ringed like the earthworm and, under the
microscope, we can plainly see all its internal
organs. The fluke lays its eggs, each one enclosed
in a little capsule, in the liver of the sheep. They
are carried to the intestines and finally set free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
along with the animal&#8217;s excrement. If then the
eggs are blown, or carried by some means to water
they will continue their development, on dry soil
they cannot long survive. Each egg gives rise to a
little organism which swims freely in the water; it is
shaded like a blunt-ended cone when extended and
is roughly oval when contracted. Its body is
covered with little whip-like structures similar to
those of the slipper animalcul&aelig;, and it is due to
the lashing of these little whips that the creature
moves through the water. If we found one of these
young flukes in some pond water we might be
forgiven for thinking it to be some near relative
of the slipper animalcule. When our subject finds
a living water snail it enters its breathing organs,
becomes affixed to their walls and loses its covering
of little whips. It becomes transformed into a
shapeless mass which later develops into an elongated
structure, quite unlike the free swimming
creature which took shelter within the snail. Next,
a migration is made to the liver of the snail where
birth is given to, from fifteen to twenty, curious
little heart-shaped organisms each with a tail about
twice as long as its body. These little creatures
escape from the snail and swim freely in the water
for a time. Eventually they make their way to
herbage growing by the waterside, affix themselves
thereto and become surrounded with a hard coat
capable of resisting the effects of hot sun or drying
winds. Should this herbage be eaten by cattle, the
apparently lifeless young fluke bestirs itself, loses its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
tail and wends its way to the liver of its host, then
the story begins again.</p>

<p>Having examined the adult liver fluke under the
microscope, we shall probably wish to find both the
free swimming young forms, and if we search carefully
in ponds to which sheep have access we are
likely to be rewarded. It is obvious that the life
of a parasite such as the liver fluke is, of necessity,
precarious. It is only chance or luck, or whatever
one&#8217;s favourite term may be, that brings the egg to
water, the young fluke to a snail, and the last free
swimming form to herbage that will be eaten by a
suitable animal. As usual in such cases, nature
makes provision for emergencies by providing a
large number of young, in order to insure that some
at least may be able to complete their development.
Owing to a series of changes, which we have omitted
to describe for the sake of simplicity, each liver fluke
egg may give rise to no less than three hundred and
twenty of the final free swimming forms.</p>

<p>As we have remarked, the study of parasites is
difficult but it is interesting. Very few of these
creatures can complete their lives without living at
the expense of two different animals. The liver fluke
needs the water snail and some herb-feeding animal;
there is another parasite which spends part of its
life in the pig and another part in the grub of the
cockchafer; a third parasite dwells for a time within
the thrush, and for the rest of its time within the
garden snail, and so on. Apart from the interest of
the subject in itself, it brings us face to face with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the fact that many quite unrelated forms of animal
life are essential to the well being of a number
of parasites. To the farmer the subject is all
important.</p>

<p>Insects of various kinds are all important in agriculture;
most of them are harmful, some few are
useful. They have, however, been dealt with in
<a href="#Page_192">another chapter</a>, so we will dismiss them here. The
ticks are closely related, and anyone with access to
a farm should be able to obtain some specimens.
Whatever species we are able to obtain should be
examined under the microscope. Their feet are
always interesting, being furnished with powerful
claws beautifully adapted to grasping the hairy coats
of their hosts. Their mouth parts are quite unlike
those of insects, and are always furnished with a
number of backwardly directed teeth, which are
useful for tearing flesh sufficiently to draw blood on
which they feed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE AND INSECT LIFE</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Some of our readers will probably remark that
entomology, or the natural history of insects,
is really a branch of zoology and should be
treated as such. We cannot pretend that they are
wrong, but it is such a specialized branch that it
merits separate treatment. Not many years ago
insects, with few exceptions, were looked upon as
harmless and often beautiful dwellers upon the earth.
They afforded endless amusement to certain enthusiasts
who collected them for their colouring or their
odd forms. Recent developments of our scientific
knowledge have shown us that the insect is, other
human beings excepted, man&#8217;s most serious rival for
the mastery of the world.</p>

<p>This state of affairs has been beautifully depicted
by an American naturalist; his words described a
by no means unlikely final scene on this earth of
ours. He wrote: &#8220;When the moon shall have
faded from the sky and the sun shall shine at noonday,
a dull cherry red, and the seas shall be frozen
over, and the ice-cap shall have crept downward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to the Equator from either pole, and no keel shall
cut the waters, nor wheels turn in mills, when all
cities shall have long been dead and crumbled into
dust and all life shall be on the very last verge of
extinction on this globe, then, on a bit of lichen,
growing on the bald rocks beside the eternal snows
of Panama, shall be seated a tiny insect, preening
its antenn&aelig; in the glow of the worn-out sun, representing
the sole survival of animal life on this our
earth&mdash;a melancholy &#8216;bug.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There is probably no field more interesting for the
microscopist than that provided by the insect world.
Unlimited explorations may be made with the certainty
of finding something new at every turn.
Most people begin their studies of insect life with
butterflies and moths; some folk to their loss never
proceed further. We may well follow the usual
course, and make a butterfly our first study.</p>

<p>Any butterfly or moth will do for our purpose,
any one with coloured wings, for some have clear
wings like those of the bees and wasps, but they
are not very common, so that we shall probably
find a suitable specimen at the first attempt. The
more highly coloured the specimen, the more attractive
it will appear under the microscope. After
killing the insect, and not before, we may proceed
to study it. Killing may best be accomplished by
means of a killing bottle, failing this a hard nip on
the body, between thumb and finger, will do, but
it must be no half-hearted proceeding or the insect
will be injured without being killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Having removed a wing and placed it on the stage
of our microscope, we must examine it by reflected
light, for it is not transparent. This may be
accomplished, if we are using artificial light, by
raising the source of illumination well above the
object, so that the light strikes it at an angle of
about forty-five degrees; by daylight reflected light
is easily managed. If we have never previously
examined a similar object we will be surprised at
its appearance. All the beautiful reds and blues,
yellows and greens which comprise the brilliant
livery of these insects are seen, under the microscope,
as hundreds of minute scales which overlap
one another like tiles on a roof. A higher magnification
will show that each scale is roughly flask-shaped,
and that its narrow end fits into a little
socket in the wing proper. When the scales are
rubbed from the wing, nothing remains but a transparent
substance traversed by veins&mdash;to the microscopist
the scaleless wing is of little interest; to the
entomologist it is important, for the moths, at anyrate,
are arranged into families largely according to
the arrangement of the veins of their wings.</p>

<p>Many other wings may be examined with advantage;
gnats, for example, are clothed with scales of
varied shape, some hair-like, some forked, some
resembling a sickle, and some disc-shaped; these
forms, by the way, do not all occur upon the wings,
but are found upon the head and other parts of the
body as well. The wonderful gauzy, iridescent
wings of dragon flies are interesting; those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
various flies worth examination also those of bees
on account of the clever device for uniting the front
and hind wings during flight. On the front edge of
the hind wings the microscope will show us a row
of minute hooks. When the bee makes a flight, it
hooks its hind wings to a ridge on the hinder edge
of the fore wings, so that for flying purposes it has,
to all intents, two wings instead of four.</p>

<p>Having examined all the wings we can find for
the time being, we may turn our attention to
mouths. The mouth parts of insects are not only
interesting but important; one of the first things an
economic entomologist does with a new specimen is
to examine its mouth parts. The mouth will tell
us what manner of feeder its owner may be. Some
insects have sucking mouths, and they must feed
perforce on liquids; others have biting mouths, and
they are likely to do damage to crops by eating
them. Then there are lancet-like mouths and
mouths which are a compromise between biting and
sucking ones. The subject, however, is somewhat
complicated, and entails a knowledge of insect
anatomy, so we will merely deal with a few easily
understood examples. Our butterfly has a sucking
mouth; it is known as a proboscis, and may be
found, coiled like a watch spring, beneath its head.
There is no trace of anything in this mouth capable
of biting or even piercing the most delicate structure.
The house-fly is also possessed of a proboscis
though of different design. Though a dangerous,
disease-carrying insect, it can do no harm with its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
mouth. The partiality of the house-fly for sugar is
well known, and it is interesting to learn how, with
its soft fleshy mouth, it can satisfy its cravings.
Let us watch one at work on a lump of sugar through
our pocket lens. If we look carefully we shall notice
that the fly, as he thrusts his proboscis here and
there, emits from it a little drop of liquid; after a
momentary pause the liquid is sucked up again,
it has dissolved a little of the sugar, and the fly
enjoys the sugar-laden liquid.</p>

<p>People frequently state that they have been bitten
by a house-fly&mdash;a sheer impossibility. What really
happens is that they mistake the very similar stable
fly for the house-fly. If one of these insects be
captured and examined, we shall find not the soft
fleshy proboscis of the house-fly, but a cruel looking,
awl-like mouth easily able to penetrate the
human skin. Certain tropical flies, known as
Pangonias, have such formidable and lengthy
piercing mouths that they can penetrate thick clothing
and puncture the skin below.</p>

<p>Microscopists who care to follow up the study of
insects&#8217; mouths will know that they are accumulating
really useful knowledge. Those who do not
desire to go so deeply into the matter may well
spare a few moments for the examination of the
green fly mouth, a needle-like piercing organ which
is thrust into plants for the purpose of sucking their
sap. The mouth of the gnat is a more difficult
subject for the microscopist, though no less interesting;
it may be compared with the same organ of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the green fly, for it is used somewhat similarly, with
the difference that it sucks blood and not plant
juices. It may be well to mention here that the
females alone suck blood, but it is easy to distinguish
the sexes, for the antenn&aelig; or feelers of the females
are thread-like whilst those of the males are
feathered. A few adult insects have no mouths, for
they never feed during their short lives.</p>

<p>Caterpillars of all kinds and also beetles, grasshoppers,
cockroaches and the like have biting-mouth
parts, and the student, who is not well versed
in insect anatomy, will learn more by watching one
of these insects partaking of a meal than by trying
to discover the uses of the various parts with the
aid of a microscope. Caterpillars as a rule are not
shy feeders, and a pocket lens will show their sickle-like
jaws in full play. The grubs of house-flies are
worth examining; they are soft and fleshy except
for a pair of horny hooks which are used to tear
up the food material. There are, however, so
many different mouths we cannot describe even the
typical ones, but the microscopist will soon discover
those of special interest.</p>

<p>The feet of insects do not show so much variation
as their mouths, nevertheless they will afford ample
material for many hours of study. Our butterfly,
which is now but a remnant, will provide our first
object. The design of its feet will depend, to some
extent, on the species of insect, but they will certainly
be clawed. Other insects with clawed feet&mdash;beetles,
bees, and wasps&mdash;may be examined, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
we shall see that there are minor differences
amongst them though their general plan is similar.
Sometimes we find a simple pair of claws on each
foot, in other cases each claw has a little spur,
whilst spiders, which, by the way, are not insects,
have comb-like claws. The foot of the house-fly is
not only provided with a pair of claws, but also
with a soft fleshy pad, by means of which it is
enabled to climb window panes and similar smooth
surfaces. If we are fortunate enough to obtain a
specimen of a louse, human or otherwise, we must
not fail to notice its strong grasping claw, used for
taking a firm hold of the hair of the creature on
which it lives. Such objects are better examined
under a high magnification, along with a hair,
then the actual method of grasping may be
observed.</p>

<p>The feelers of some insects are interesting; those
of gnats we have already mentioned, but they may
be examined in detail. Those of beetles are of very
diverse form; some are thread-like, some clubbed,
some fan-shaped. Moths, too, have many curious
designs to show. Some of these feelers, when highly
magnified, may be seen to be pitted&mdash;hundreds of
little sunken areas are scattered over their surfaces,
and it is probable that they are connected with a
sense of smell. In that case the feeler is a more
important organ than one might surmise from its
popular name.</p>

<p>The hairy clothing of insects need not delay us
long. Most interesting of all are the feathered hairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of certain bees. In our <a href="#Page_97">chapter on botanical work</a>
with the microscope we mentioned the feathery
stigmas of grass flowers and we also stated that they
took that form, so that pollen grains blown to them
would be entangled in their branches. The hairs of
many bees are feathered for a similar reason, they
gather pollen and the pollen adheres to these
&#8220;feathers&#8221; much more readily and in much greater
quantity, than it would to simple, unbranched hairs.
Some bees collect no pollen and, from them,
feathered hairs are wanting.</p>

<p>Any microscopist who has followed us thus far,
will have a fair idea of the structure of a number of
insects. In every case, where possible, comparisons
should be made between similar organs of different
insects and the investigations may be made more
interesting by observing the habits of the insects and
trying to discover reasons for the differences in
structure. It is safe to surmise that there is a reason
in every case. There are many other interesting
subjects which we have not mentioned, the legs of
insects&mdash;running legs of ground beetles, digging legs
of mole crickets, swimming legs of water beetles and
the wonderful pollen-carrying legs of bees. Then
again, the eggs of many insects are of surpassing
beauty in shape, they may be round, oval, oblong,
nearly square and almost needle shaped; some are
smooth and shining like burnished metal, others
beautifully sculptured; some resemble miniature
birds&#8217; eggs, others are not unlike the seeds of plants.</p>

<p>Many insects are too small to be cut up into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their various parts, legs, feet, wings, etc., by unskilled
hands and they must be examined whole.
Perhaps you may think that an insect will be too
big an object for your microscope. Indeed there
are some insects which measure nearly a foot in
length, but there are, on the other hand, beetles
no longer than one hundredth part of an inch.
When we examined the house-fly it is not unlikely
that we found some minute creatures living upon it.
None of these is likely to be an insect, but as they
are closely related we may mention them here.
Beneath the wings of the house fly there are often
minute, red, six legged young mites, all eagerly
sucking the juices of their host. Because they are
six legged we may be led to think that they are
insects, for the entomologist knows that the true
insect, in its adult form, never has more than six
legs. These mites, however, later in life, drop from
the fly and by developing another pair of legs appear
in their true colours. Various other mites,
including cheesemites, may be found clinging to the
house-fly, in fact it is by the aid of these insects
that cheesemites are often carried from cheese to
cheese. One of the most curious parasites of the
house-fly must be sought upon its legs. If the search
is successful, curious, reddish-brown creatures,
armed with formidable pincers, and strangely reminiscent
of miniature lobsters, will be found clinging
thereto. They are called chelifers and their home is
the manure heap, so that their presence shows us
only too well where our friend the fly has recently
disported himself. His next visit was probably to
our food.</p>

<p>If we can find a swiftly running stream within
easy reach a little time may be spent in searching
the submerged rocks and plants for the miniature
stages of the buffalo gnat. This insect, which is
known to scientists as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simulium</i>, has a most interesting
life history. Its popular name is derived
from its hump-backed appearance and its supposed
resemblance to a buffalo. The female lays her eggs
on a rock or reed, just covered by running water,
she never lays them in still water. The greenish-brown,
club-shaped grubs which come from the eggs
are curious and they will repay examination under
a low magnification. At the more blunt end of the
creature there is a large sucker; it uses this as a
foot to support itself in an upright position. If we
examine our specimen under water we shall see that
its horny head is decorated with a pair of fans, each
one composed of about fifty threads. These fans
open and close with a rhythmic movement and, in
doing so, attract small floating water plants to the
mouth. Just below the head there is a single leg
with a sucker foot. When the grub walks, it does
so by a looping movement, holding fast to its
support with fore and hind suckers alternately.</p>

<p>The next stage in the life of the young buffalo
gnat is even more curious. On the surface of some
submerged leaf we shall probably be able to find
a number of the slipper-shaped pockets made of
closely woven silk, in which the insect spends the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
final portion of its life before turning into the perfect
fly. Within some of the pockets we shall find
the creature itself and it must be studied. Its head
is still ornamented with a pair of fans, but in this
case they are gills by means of which the insect
breathes and not food scoops, for it has reached a
stage when food is not taken. On its tail end there
is a hook, by means of which it anchors itself to
its slipper-shaped pocket. Probably we shall find
bubbles of air collecting round some of the insects,
within their pockets; as the time approaches nearer
and nearer for the change to the perfect insect to
take place the bubbles grow larger and larger.
Eventually the fly emerges within a bubble, shakes
it free from the pocket and floats to the surface of
the water without wetting its wings.</p>

<p>The pond will supply insects quite as interesting
as the running stream. Here we may find the eggs
of Caddis flies, enclosed in jelly-like envelopes, rope-like,
horse-shoe shaped or simple masses. The
caterpillar cases of these insects should be slightly
magnified and examined, for they are marvellously
constructed of shells or sand, pieces of stick, leaves
or other vegetation.</p>

<p>We may come across the young stages of the
common gnat. Its eggs are very small and when
the mother gnat lays them on the surface of ponds
she glues them together so that they form what is
known as an &#8220;egg raft.&#8221; The &#8220;raft&#8221; we shall
notice, if we examine it carefully, is composed of
a large number of eggs; each egg is elongated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
pointed at one end and blunt at the other. Every
egg is arranged with its blunt end downwards for,
from that end, the larv&aelig; gnats make their way into
the water. A larva, it may be explained, is the stage
in insect development which follows the egg; the
next stage is known as the pupa. When the eggs
are first laid they are white but, before they hatch,
they become darker and darker, till they are almost
black. The larv&aelig; which hatch from the eggs we
must examine under our microscope and also in
the water&mdash;they may easily be kept in a small jar
of pond water. If we study their habits carefully,
we shall observe that they float almost at right
angles to the surface of the water and that, while
doing so, the tip of a little peg-like outgrowth on
the tail end of their bodies is thrust out of the water.
The little peg is the breathing organ of the gnat
larva and the flaps which open and close at its tip
are worth examination. In a few days, the denizens
of our pond water will change their appearance and
become comma shaped. On their heads we shall
see a pair of curious horns, which project out of the
water as the creatures, which have now become
pup&aelig;, float at the surface. The horns are breathing
organs. As we examine these pup&aelig;, day by day,
we shall see the various parts of the complete gnat
as they develop within the body of the comma.
Finally, under the microscope, we can trace all the
parts of the gnat. Darker and darker the little
creatures become, as development proceeds; at the
same time they become less active and less comma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
shaped. At length the time comes when they
straighten their tails somewhat violently, their skin
splits along the back and out comes the perfect
gnat. We can use him for further microscopic work,
so we will not let him go. If he be a male, his
beautiful feathered feelers or, if a female, her thread-like
feelers will make good objects for us, the scales
from head and body, the wings and feet are all
worth the time we may spend in examining them.
The mouth parts, too, are interesting but rather
complicated.</p>

<p>Many insects are capable of emitting more or less
musical sounds. In some countries these so-called
singing insects are kept as pets, in other countries
the same insects are voted a nuisance; it is all a
matter of taste. Of all musical insects, the most
noted is the Cicada and its sound organs are easily
seen; they occur only in the male, for the female
never sings. The Cicada belongs to the same great
order of insects as the green fly, which we have
already mentioned. There is one British species,
and our readers who visit the New Forest may come
upon it. On the under side of one of these insects
the beak, very similar to the beak of the green fly,
may be plainly seen. On either side of the insect,
just below the bases of the wings there are two
nearly round discs. These discs cover the sound
organs, which are two ear shaped membranes. By
means of muscles the insect can cause the membranes
to vibrate and thus produce the sound which
once heard, can never be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>More easily found insects, in this country, at any
rate, are the cricket and the grasshopper. The
cricket we all know is a persistent songster. Let
us examine him closely. We shall find, that the
house cricket has two pairs of wings; the fore wings
are leathery, the hind wings membranous. If we
watch a male in the act of chirping, the male
crickets like the male Cicadas are the songsters, we
shall observe that he moves his wings slightly. If
now we examine a dead male, we shall find, on the
under surface of the forewing, a rough patch. Let
us examine this patch under the microscope, it reminds
us of nothing so much as a file: it is a file
in fact, and sound is produced by rubbing this rough
file against a ridge, which we can easily see, on the
upper surface of the hind wing.</p>

<p>It would be a useless accomplishment for the
cricket to be able to sing, if there were no ears to
hear its song. Nature has arranged that his song
shall not go unheard and if we examine a female
cricket, that is to say a cricket which has no sound-producing
apparatus, we shall find an oval depression,
covered by a membrane, on each of her front
legs; these are her ears and they enable her to hear
her mate calling to her.</p>

<p>We have often heard the song of the grasshopper
as we have walked through the fields and he too
will occupy our time for a few moments. When he
sings, he kicks his legs rather violently and this
gives us a clue to the situation of his vocal organs.
The inside of each of his hind thighs is ridged and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the edge of each ridge is, as we can see if we magnify
it, rough like a file. This file-like ridge is rubbed
against a smooth ridge on the edge of the fore wing
and the result is the familiar note of the grasshopper.</p>

<p>This insect also has ears, but they are not easy
to find unless they are pointed out to us. If we
examine a grasshopper we shall see that its body
is divided into three parts: a head, a solid portion
from which the wings and legs arise, the thorax and
a portion (the abdomen) made up of a number of
rings or segments. On the sides of the first of these
rings, counting from the forward end, we shall find
small depressions covered with membrane, these are
the ears. It is curious that although many of the
grasshoppers cannot give out a note, so far as human
ears can detect, they nearly all have ears; maybe
there is a grasshopper song which only grasshoppers
can hear.</p>

<p>Very many other insects have sound organs, but
they are nearly all constructed on the same plan.
It may seem surprising that sounds can be produced
by these simple means. Sound is really caused by
waves in the air and these insect vocal organs set
up rapid sound waves, by their vibration.</p>

<p>The microscopist should never be at a loss for
objects derived from the insect world: it is impossible
to walk without treading upon some six legged
wayfarer. The wing cases of beetles are often of
rare beauty, some on account of their sculpturing,
some because of a mantle of scales.</p>

<p>In our greenhouse and garden we can find mealy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
bugs, curious little powdered insects which do an
enormous amount of damage. The fringe wings,
or Thrips, are common and destructive; examine
their curious feet and their beautifully fringed wings,
the sight will repay you. And lastly, if you number
an insect enthusiast amongst your friends, enlist his
aid in gathering objects for your microscope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE BY THE SEASIDE&mdash;ANIMAL LIFE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">It is always surprising that the majority of
microscopists never dream of examining any of
the hundreds of beautiful objects which can be
found by the seaside, in the course of an afternoon&#8217;s
ramble. That every pond will contain ample material
for study, the microscopist knows instinctively; insect
life and plant life also he studies, but the microscope
is generally left at home when a visit is paid
to the seaside. A rocky coast is better than a
sandy one, for rock pools yield many objects, and
the warmer southern waters of our coasts are better
than the colder northern seas, but the microscopist
who finds himself on a northern sandy coast need not
despair, if he search diligently he will find material
enough to occupy him for many a day.</p>

<p>Nearly every rock pool will provide one or more
Sea Anemones; it is hardly necessary to describe
these &#8220;flowers of the sea&#8221; as they have been called,
they are such familiar objects and the brilliant
colouring of some of them makes them highly attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
In many respects Sea Anemones resemble
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i>, one of the pond dwellers, they are rather
more highly developed, however. Any Sea Anemone
will serve our purpose because we are about to examine
the little darts with which its tentacles, and
even its body, are armed. If we find several different
kinds of Anemone, we must take the most transparent
we can find and also a small specimen;
we can examine the larger, more opaque ones later.
Having transferred our specimen to a small jar,
containing but a small quantity of sea water, we
wait till it has recovered from its transfer and spread
its tentacles, then it must be killed by one of the
methods suggested in our concluding chapter (see
<a href="#Page_306">p. 306</a>). One of the tentacles must then be snipped
off with scissors&mdash;some people cut off the tentacle
without killing the Anemone and the animal does
not appear to suffer a great amount of inconvenience,
in fact a new tentacle soon grows to take
the place of the old one. We do not recommend
promiscuous vivisection. The tentacle is placed on
a clean slide, a cover slip placed over it and pressure
is applied. An enormous number of little
thread-like darts are pressed from all parts of the
tentacle. In some cases, little oval capsules are
squeezed out and, in the capsules, the darts may
be plainly seen, coiled up. On applying pressure
to a capsule, the contained dart will shoot forth,
much as does a glove finger turned inside out, when
we blow violently into the glove. These little darts
are of the greatest interest to the microscopist; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
vary in shape according to the kind of Anemone,
as we shall find if we try this experiment with
various Anemones. Some of them are straight with
stiff bristles at their bases; some have backwardly
directed barbs at their tips; others are apparently
jointed, forming a zigzag, with a short length of the
dart going from left to right, the next short length
from right to left, and so on to the tip. It is marvellous
how the darts can be accommodated within
the capsule, for the average length of the latter is
but <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">300</span> inch whereas its dart may measure <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span>
inch. These little threads contain a poison capable
of paralyzing any moderate-sized fishes which they
touch.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a &#8220;comb bearer&#8221; or as it
is often called, a &#8220;marble bleb?&#8221; Probably you have
though you may not know its name. Sometimes
it occurs in rock pools, though more often it is
found in one&#8217;s shrimping net and occasionally it is
washed up by the tide, but it does not live long out
of water. The &#8220;marble bleb,&#8221; as its name denotes,
is an almost globular mass of soft, transparent
jelly. It is practically colourless, with the exception
of eight bright coloured bands which run
from end to end of the animal. To the
naked eye, this little denizen of the sea is of
rare beauty: as an object for low-power microscopy
it is entrancing.</p>

<p>When magnified, the bright bands are seen to be
composed of rows of flattened outgrowths. If our
specimen is small enough to be examined in water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
its real beauty can only be seen in this manner, we
shall observe that the flattened outgrowths act like
paddles, sometimes they work all together, sometimes
independently of one another and this fact
explains the marvellous evolutions of the &#8220;marble
bleb&#8221; in water. Now it shoots forward in a straight
line with some rapidity, now it rolls over and over
and swims onward while doing so.</p>

<p>In the sun, it displays glorious iridescent colouring.
At the hinder end of the &#8220;bleb&#8221; we notice
a pair of hollows: from these, as we watch it swim,
we shall see it suddenly shoot out a pair of long
feathery tendrils and they may be withdrawn into
the hollows as suddenly. We must make a point of
examining the &#8220;marble bleb,&#8221; it is one of the gems
of our coasts.</p>

<p>Superficially the common, sponge-like &#8220;Dead
man&#8217;s toes&#8221; or, to give it its more pleasant title,
&#8220;Mermaid&#8217;s fingers,&#8221; is a very drab affair. It is
a dirty-brown lobed, spongy mass with a leathery
skin; when removed from the water it loses all
semblance of shape. In sea water, however, if we
examine it carefully, we shall see that it is studded
with beautiful little flower-like creatures, each one
resembling a miniature Sea Anemone. Examined, in
water, under a low power of our microscope we can
see the water current flowing through the channels
with which it is perforated, after the manner of a
sponge. If, now, we take a dead specimen and cut
it up, placing a small portion on a slide and shredding
it with a pair of needles, we shall find, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
we magnify the result of our work, that there are
a number of minute mineral spikes, called spicules,
and very beautiful objects they make for the microscope.
There are many sea-side creatures, which
we may find, closely related to &#8220;Mermaid&#8217;s
fingers,&#8221; they may all be treated in the same way
for they will all yield spicules which will repay us
for our trouble. All these spongy organisms are
not provided with spicules as ornaments, though
one might be forgiven for thinking so, seeing
how decorative many of them are. Their
presence is necessary to strengthen the spongy
material.</p>

<p>The specimen we have just examined is not one
animal but a colony of very minute animals. These
colonies are very common, not only in salt but also
in fresh water. They serve a useful purpose, for
the creatures composing them are so minute that
they would fare badly did they dwell alone. Dwelling
together as they do and each one contributing
its share to the building of the home they appear
to thrive to a wonderful degree. The coral islands
are built, as to their foundations at anyrate, by
millions of very minute animals, living together in
colonies.</p>

<p>We mentioned the sponges a moment ago and
many of them may be found around our coasts;
not the household sponges we know so well, but
much smaller, though equally interesting, colonies.
Like the better known sponges, those which we find
on our shores are perforated with a number of holes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
through which the water is driven by means of little
whip-like structures which line the cavities. Professor
Grant has graphically described his impressions
at witnessing this water current for the first
time. &#8220;I put a small branch of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spongia
Coalita</i>,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;with some sea water in a
watch glass, under the microscope, and, on reflecting
the light of a candle up through the fluid, I soon
perceived that there was some internal motion in
the opaque particles floating through the water.
On moving the watch glass, so as to bring one of
the apertures on the side of the sponge fully into
view, I beheld, for the first time, the splendid
spectacle of this living fountain vomiting forth
from a circular cavity an impetuous torrent of liquid
matter, and hurling along, in rapid succession,
opaque masses, which it strewed everywhere around.
The beauty and novelty of such a scene in the
Animal Kingdom long arrested my attention; but
after twenty-five minutes of constant observation,
I was obliged to withdraw my eye from fatigue,
without having seen the torrent for one instant
change its direction, or diminish, in the slightest
degree, the rapidity of its course. I continued to
watch the same orifice, at short intervals, for five
hours, sometimes observing it for a quarter of an
hour at a time, but still the stream rolled on with
a constant and even velocity. About the end of
this time, however, I observed the current to become
perceptibly languid ... and in one hour more
the current had entirely ceased.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Frequently the sponge we examine may be found
to be studded with many yellowish spots; closer
examination will show that these spots are composed
of very small jelly covered eggs. Later these eggs
find their way into the cavities of the sponge and
are forced therefrom in the currents of water. Each
of the young sponges thus expelled is furnished with
a covering of little whips, by means of which it
swims about till it can find a suitable spot on which
to anchor and complete its growth.</p>

<p>The Sea Anemone, which has already provided
us with objects for our microscope, has many near
relatives which we must make a point of examining,
while we have the opportunity. Many of these
creatures, or rather their colonies, for they do not
live singly, are to the naked eye, strangely like seaweeds.
A number of them are moss-like and may
be found on wooden breakwaters and similar situations
when the tide is low; they should be collected
and examined and, to see them at their best they
should be examined under water. It is hardly necessary
to describe any one of these colonies in detail,
for they are so numerous that the one we described
might not come into the hands of our readers for
a long time. In general characters they are all
somewhat similar so we will confine ourselves to
generalities. For the most part, the stems and
branches of these colonies are of the thickness of
thread. As we watch them under the microscope
we shall see that they are studded with little cups
and, presently, from each little cup there appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
a little tuft of tentacles which is waved about in the
water. Each member of the colony is similar to
its neighbour and each one, again, is very
like the fresh water <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydra</i> with which we are
familiar.</p>

<p>Of all the common objects of the sea shore one
of the commonest everywhere is the sea-mat. Nine
people out of ten or, we might safely say that everyone
who had not learned its true nature, would guess
it to be a seaweed. As we find it washed up on
the beach it is almost the colour of sand, somewhat
rough to the touch, whilst its whole surface is pitted
with minute holes. The sea-mat, when dry as we
usually find it, is a remnant of a colony of sea
dwellers very similar to those we have just described.
From each little hole, in a living specimen, which
we can find without much difficulty, there appear
the familiar tentacles; each hole is the home of a
minute hydra-like animal.</p>

<p>Hooke, whom we mentioned in our <a href="#Page_17">chapter on
the History of the Microscope</a>, though a careful
observer, was quite misled by the sea-mat; he
thought it was a seaweed, for he wrote: &#8220;I have
not, among all plants and vegetables I have yet
observed, seen any one comparable to this seaweed.
It is a plant which grows upon the rocks under
water and increases and spreads itself into a great
tuft, which is not only handsomely branched into
several leaves, but the whole surface is covered
over with a most curious knot of carved work,
which consists of a texture much resembling a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
honeycomb, for the whole surface on both sides is
covered over with a multitude of very small holes,
being no larger than so many holes made with a
pin, and ranged in the neatest and most delicate
order imaginable, they being placed in the manner
of a quincunx, or very much like the rows of eyes
of a fly, the rows or orders being very regular
which way soever they are observed. These little
holes, which to the eye look round, when magnified,
appear very regularly shaped holes, representing
almost the shape of a round-toed shoe, the hinder
part of each being, as it were, turned in, or covered
by the toe of the next below it. These holes seemed
walled about with very thin and transparent substance,
looking of a pale straw colour, from the
edge of which, against the middle of each hole, were
sprouted out four small, transparent, straw-coloured
thorns, which seemed to protect and cover those
cavities.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a well-known author has remarked: &#8220;This
is really a wonderfully faithful description of the
common sea-mat, and one cannot help picturing
the surprise and delight of old author Hooke, could
he have seen a portion of a living colony under a
modern microscope.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of our finds may be the &#8220;Bird&#8217;s head.&#8221; It is
a branched form, quite unlike the sea-mat but it is of
even greater interest. Under the microscope, we
shall see the many waving tentacles, but another
feature is sure to attract our attention, a feature
which is responsible for the popular name of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
colony. On the outside of each cavity containing
a member of the colony there is a structure which
resembles nothing so much as a hawk-like bird&#8217;s
head atop of a long neck. While the tentacles wave
in the water, the bird&#8217;s head snaps vigorously,
moved here and moved there. The birds&#8217; heads,
which might be mistaken for parasites stealing food
from the waving tentacles, really perform the useful
function of keeping them clean and warding off
creatures which might do them harm.</p>

</div>

<p>Now let us pass to quite different though equally
common sea shore animals, the star fish. There
are very many kinds but the common star fish will
serve our purpose well. We may make a beginning
by examining his back under a low magnification
and observing that it is protected by a number of
hard plates which form a very efficient armour.
At the point where two of the rays (the finger like
structures) arise we shall notice a small flat plate,
this too is worth a moment&#8217;s inspection, for it is
the water pore through which the star fish takes in
water.</p>

<p>The under surface of the star fish shows us of
course its mouth in the centre of its body, the soft
fleshy suckers which cover the rays, with the exception
of a narrow line down the centre of each one.
At the tip of each ray there is an eye; it may
easily be distinguished by its bright red colour and
microscopic examination will show us that it is quite
unlike any of the other eyes we have examined.
Over each eye there is a little tentacle; these little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
tentacles may be called the noses of the star fish,
for, by means of them it is able to smell. They are
as unlike our idea of a nose as are the little pits
on the feeler of the cockchafer which we examined,
yet these noses and ours all perform the same duties.
Our time will be well spent if we devote some of it
to a search for others less common star fish. Some
of them are really beautiful and whatever specimens
we come across can be compared with the common
variety which is everywhere.</p>

<p>Closely related to the star fish are the sea-urchins.
The relationship may not be apparent at first sight
but a careful study of an urchin and a star will
reveal many points of similarity. Our object in
these pages, however, is to find material for our
microscope and not to unfold the relationships of
various members of the Animal Kingdom. When
we have learned to cut sections, we may try our
hand at the spine of a sea-urchin, it is an object
well worthy of study. The hard shell of the urchin
may be examined under a low magnification, we
shall see then that his armour is far more highly
developed than that of the star fish.</p>

<p>Another near relative of the two animals we have
just described is the sea slug or sea cucumber.
Though an article of commerce of some importance
in the far East, the sea slug is not so common on
our coasts as its relations. We must make a point
of finding a specimen, however, for it provides us
with one of the most remarkable objects for our
microscope that could possibly be imagined. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
species, which goes by the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Synapta
Inh&aelig;rens</i>, is the one most worthy of examination.
We must describe the creature first of all so that
we may know what to look for. It is aptly named
sea cucumber for it is not unlike that fruit&mdash;yes!
fruit is correct, though the cucumber is more often
called a vegetable. The animal&#8217;s skin is tough and
leathery and at the head end there is a fringe of
feathery tentacles. The sea cucumber must be
looked for amongst sea weeds or, maybe, he lies
buried in the sand, with only his fringe of tentacles
on view. A friendly fisherman will probably aid
us in our search.</p>

<p>Having found our creature we must examine his
leathery skin under the microscope. To the touch
it is evident that it is studded with some flinty
matter, but the microscope alone can show us the
amazing beauty of this armour. Under a low
magnification, we can see, dotted over the leathery
skin, some nearly circular plates to each of which
is attached a little anchor. Now, from a dead
animal of course, we must scrape away some of
these objects and examine them with a higher
magnification. Even the hardened microscopist will
be delighted when he sees the armour of the sea
cucumber for the first time. Each anchor is hinged
to a little plate, each little plate, nearly circular in
outline, is perforated with seven holes, six round
the circumference and one in the centre and every
perforation has a toothed margin. So perfect are
these minute plates and anchors, that the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
intricate man-made machinery could not have
turned them out more perfectly to pattern. They
are precisely similar to one another in size and
shape; as objects for the microscope, even the sea
with all its store of wonders, can offer us nothing
more marvellous.</p>

<p>We may number the sea mouse amongst our
treasures of the sea-side. Though called a mouse,
on account of its curious movements and partly
perhaps because of its appearance, it is really a
worm. It does not appear to have the slightest
resemblance to the common earth worm, nor to the
liver fluke which is described on another page,
nevertheless, it is related to both these creatures.
The raiment of the sea mouse is gorgeous in the
extreme; on its back is soft brownish hair, its sides
are clothed with yellow and green hair, displaying
a wonderful iridescence and amongst the hair on
the sides there are many stiff brown bristles. Of
the covering of the sea mouse it has been said:
&#8220;It is as if all the hues of the rainbow were collected
there, making this remarkable animal a living
jewel, and truly worthy of the name of Aphrodite,
the Queen of Beauty.&#8221; The bristles of this creature
we must examine microscopically, they vary in
structure according to the kind of sea mouse, for
there are several kinds, but in some of them they
are formidably barbed, in all of them they act as
a protection.</p>

<p>Many other worms, a number of them un-wormlike
in appearance will claim our attention but we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cannot devote more space to them here. There is
the common shell-binder, a curious worm, which
builds for itself a still more curious shelter of
broken shells. Another worm, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serpula</i> by name,
also lives in tube-like structures of its own manufacture
and is remarkable in that a row of nearly
two thousand seven-toothed hooks run along its
back and all these thirteen thousand odd teeth are
there merely for the purpose of holding <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serpula</i> in
its tubular home.</p>

<p>Much interesting work may be done at the seaside
in studying the young stages of various familiar
creatures. This work, however, necessitates the
keeping of the adults in an aquarium; for the young
ones, in most cases, are so unlike their parents that,
if found swimming about on their own account, they
would never be recognised. Young barnacles, for
instance, have six legs, a tubular mouth and a single
eye. At a later stage they might be mistaken for
young shell fish; they possess a shell, not unlike
that of the mussel, containing, however, not a soft,
fleshy mollusc but a six legged creature which
swims through the water in jerks, after the manner
of a water flea. Strangely enough, it is now provided
with two stalked eyes like those of a crab,
whilst of mouth parts it has none, or they are so
imperfectly developed as to be useless for feeding.
Soon this active youngster settles down for the
rest of its life and becomes a sedate and sedentary
barnacle, with one imperfectly developed eye and a
mouth capable of feeding to good purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Young crabs are equally curious and also totally
unlike their parents, but these curious creatures are
hardly accessible to those who only pay a flying
visit to the sea-side. As we have remarked, an
aquarium is a necessity and to keep marine animals
inland is a feat beyond the powers of the ordinary
mortal.</p>

<p>The Sea Lemon or Doris is a curious little
creature, worthy of examination. Its habit is to
feed upon sponges and strange diet it is, for we
remember that all sponges are fortified with hard
flinty structures, called spicules. This habit of the
Sea Lemon is of use to the microscopist, for the
stomach of the creature is always laden with the
indigestible spicules and a very interesting collection
of these beautiful structures may be gathered
together in this manner. The egg masses of Doris
may be looked for on rocks during the summer.
Enormous numbers of eggs are laid in a jelly-like
mass. Some of this jelly may be collected and
examined under the microscope and, should we have
collected our material at a favourable moment, we
may watch the eggs hatch and observe the young
Sea Lemons in their delicate transparent shells
swimming round and round the chamber within
which they are imprisoned during the very early
stages of their lives.</p>

<p>Very frequently in the summer, when the seas
are warm any agitation of the water causes a
beautiful phosphorescence to appear. Phosphorescence,
by the way, may be described as light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
without heat and it is not uncommon in nature.
Glow worms and fireflies are phosphorescent; fish,
also, in the dead state, often emit a certain amount
of light as do bones whilst, of course, phosphorous
itself is the best example of a naturally phosphorescent
body. Phosphorescent sea water, however,
owes its peculiarity to myriads of minute animals
and they will afford us an interesting half hour with
the microscope. Let us collect a little of this water
in a glass jar and take it into a darkened room
that we may the better see the phosphorescence.
When the water in the jar is undisturbed, we can
see nothing unusual; if we stir it or strike it a faint
greenish light is given off, but it does not last for
long. Now, on taking the jar into the daylight, as
soon as our eyes are accustomed to the light, we
shall just be able to see that there are some very
small living creatures on the surface of the water.
We must examine one, under a fairly high magnification;
it may be transferred, from the jar to a
drop of water on our slide, by means of a paint
brush. The little animal which is responsible for
the phosphorescence of sea water is strangely reminiscent
of an apple with its stalk. It is, of course,
very minute being only <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">60</span> inch in diameter and
its tail, which we have compared to the stalk of the
apple, is equal to the diameter in length. The
whole creature is quite transparent. As we
watch it swim in our drop of water, we shall
notice that it propels itself by the lashing of
its tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>There are countless animals of the sea we have
not so much as mentioned, but the marine gardens
contain plants so interesting and so totally unlike
those which live upon land that we must devote
a few pages to them also.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE BY THE SEASIDE&mdash;PLANT LIFE</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The plant life of the sea side may be divided
into two natural groups (i) of plants living
on the shore near the sea and (ii) of plants
living in the sea, for part of each day at least. The
former group contains many plants of exactly the
same kind as occur far inland, together with a few
typically sea-side plants such as Thrift or Sea Pink.
They are, however, one and all land plants. In this
chapter we shall confine ourselves to the real sea
plants, the seaweeds.</p>

<p>Before we study any of these interesting plants
under the microscope, it will be useful to learn a
little about seaweeds in general, because they are
so totally unlike land plants in every respect. They
belong to the great plant division known as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>, to which also belong the Diatoms, Desmids,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvox</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> and many of the other plants we
mentioned in our <a href="#Page_83">chapter on Pond Life</a>. So we see
that, although all seaweeds are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>, not all <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>
are seaweeds. They are higher in the scale of development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
than Fungi, to which Bacteria, Yeast,
Mould, etc., belong, though they are not so highly
developed as Ferns and not nearly so advanced as
flowering plants. A very short acquaintance with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> will show us that they are either green,
brown or red. The green <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> are nearly all fresh
water forms, though a few are to be found
in the sea; on the other hand brown and red
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> are common in the sea and rare in fresh
water.</p>

<p>As we study our seaweeds on the shore, if we are
really observant, we shall notice that they live in
zones or belts according to their colour. There are
exceptions to this rule but, in general, the green
seaweeds dwell in situations where they are only
covered by the sea at high tide; the red seaweeds
are to be found mostly where they are always below
water and, between the two, the brown seaweeds
occur. In some parts, this colour scheme is very
striking. Frequently red seaweeds may be found
above high-water mark it is true, but in such cases
they nearly always occur in rock pools and they are
invariably sheltered by brown seaweeds.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#Page_97">chapter on plant life</a> we mentioned that
many coloured plants contained the green colouring
matter, chlorophyll, just as do the ordinary green
leaves. We showed too that by boiling some green
leaves in methylated spirits we could extract the
chlorophyll and that its solution had the peculiar
property of appearing green when light passes
through it and red when light is reflected from it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
If now we take almost any brown or red seaweed,
we cannot see a trace of chlorophyll anywhere.
Let us leave our specimen, however, in fresh water
for a few days when we shall find that the brown
or red colouring matter as the case may be, is dissolved
by the water and a green plant remains.
By treating the seaweed, deprived of its distinctive
colour, with methylated spirit as described above,
we can obtain a solution of chlorophyll.</p>

<p>The microscopist who is anxious to make a study
of seaweeds, will find little scope for his hobby on
a sandy shore. Just as the most interesting marine
animals are to be found where rocks abound, so
must we hunt in similar situations for our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>.
A few thread like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> are able to anchor themselves
to the sand but most of them require a substantial
support. A bare rock is a much favoured
situation and before we have learned the peculiarities
of these plants we may marvel how they obtain
any sustenance from so barren a resting place. As
a matter of fact they derive no nourishment from
the rocks on which they rest. The part of the sea
weed which, in our ignorance, we may have dubbed
a root, is nothing of the kind. It bears no relationship
to the roots of higher plants and is a
mere anchor, designed to fasten its owner to
a support.</p>

<p>None of these plants have roots, none have true
stems or leaves, though the parts resembling stems
and leaves are often so called; none of them flower
and so fruits and seeds are unknown to them. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
food is absorbed from the sea water over the whole
of their surface.</p>

<p>We may well begin our study of the seaweeds
with an examination of the external structure of as
many different kinds as we can find. Some of them
are flattened and very thin forms and of them the
Sea Lettuce may be taken as typical. This plant,
known to scientists as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulva Lactuca</i>, occurs at high-water
mark. In its fully developed form it is pale
green and so thin as to be almost transparent; its
structure may be studied under the microscope
without difficulty. Then there is the very common,
green, Compressed Enteromorpha which grows in
great profusion on the rocks of the shore, rendering
them exceedingly slippery. The closely related
Intestinal Enteromorpha as it floats in the water
resembles a green, membranous tube and those of
us who have ever done any zoological dissection will
appreciate how well named this plant is. The structure
of both the Enteromorphas can easily be seen.
Many of the brown and red <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> will provide us
with a good deal of occupation in making out their
structure. Some of them, the brown <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus
Siliculosus</i> for example, may be found, growing in
moss like tufts, which are usually attached to one
of the larger <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> living between the tide marks.
It is one of the simplest of the brown sea weeds,
consisting of branched threads, but one cell in
thickness. The Wracks, of which the Common
Bladder Wrack or Pop weed with its little air filled
bladders is familiar to everyone, are more complicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in structure, in fact they appear to be possessed
of stems and leaves, but we shall return to
them in a moment.</p>

<p>Most of the common red <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> are so delicate in
structure that they require a fairly high magnification
for their examination. The thin, membranous
fronds of the beautiful crimson <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delessera Sanguinea</i>,
may be sought below low tide limit or may be found
washed up upon the shore. Superficially the plant
resembles a red hart&#8217;s-tongue fern, with much more
delicate fronds than ever fern of that species possessed.
We may well compare its structure with
that of the sea lettuce, for it is equally transparent.</p>

<p>In the rock pools of many parts of the coast we
may happen upon a most curious almost white sea
weed, known as Coralline or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corallina Officinalis</i>.
Its branched, feathery stems are hard and stony and
the whole plant bears a superficial resemblance to
a coral, hence its name. The plant absorbs a substance
known as calcium carbonate from the sea
water and deposits it in the form of a hard, stony
covering over its surface. Calcium carbonate does
not occur in sea water everywhere, at least not in
sufficient quantity to be of use to the Coralline, that
is the reason the sea weed is not quite so common
as some of the others we have mentioned. The
curious armour-plating of this sea dweller, should
be studied under the microscope.</p>

<p>The chief scientific interest of the sea weeds,
however, lies in their mode of increase, it is so
totally different from that of any of the higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
plants. The most simple method of increase is
known as vegetative reproduction, it does not occur
in every kind of seaweed and is nothing more or less
than the growth of a broken piece of plant into
a new individual. This form of increase is not unknown
higher in the plant world; begonia leaves
may be induced to send forth roots and grow into
new plants, many garden favourites are propagated
by means of cuttings and both these methods are
similar to the breaking away and growth of portions
of a seaweed; the garden plants, however,
are assisted by man, the seaweed does its own work.</p>

<p>The simplest forms of increase occur amongst
those giants of the sea, the Laminarias or Tangles
as they are often called. These brown seaweeds
often attain enormous sizes, they all grow below the
limits of low tide and appear to thrive best where
the water is frequently lashed by storms. To see
these plants at their best we must look down upon
them in their watery home. There are spots on the
North-Eastern coast of Ireland, where one may
look from the cliffs upon a veritable forest of
Tangles. There thrives the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Apron,&#8221; short
of stem but with a flat ribbon of a frond, which
may attain a length of a dozen feet and a width of
as many inches. There too we can behold the
Fingered Tangle, with stem, maybe, six feet in
length and a crown of large finger-like fronds, &#8220;Sea
Laces&#8221; or &#8220;Dead Men&#8217;s Ropes,&#8221; with fronds resembling
slender ropes, in length, at times as much
as forty feet, ride gracefully on the ever changing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
currents. Safely hidden in this marine forest lurk
queer fishes and crabs and shell fish. About the
broad fronds of the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Apron&#8221; sea mice and
sea cucumbers disport themselves; the Tangle home
is a paradise for marine life. Yet with all their
vigorous growth they increase simply by liberating
spores which give rise to new plants.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#Page_97">chapter on Plant Life</a> we described spores
very briefly; we said that from a strictly scientific
point of view they were not comparable to seeds
but that for our purpose they might be looked upon
as seeds for the reason that, by their germination,
new plants were formed. All the spores of land
plants are minute, they are carried from the mother
plant to suitable spots for germination by wind.
The spores of seaweeds also are small, but they are
very different to the little wind-blown, land-dwelling
spores. They possess a pair of the curious little
whip-like structures we have observed in so many
water plants and animals. By the lashing of these
little whips they are able to swim about in the
water till they find a suitable spot to settle down
and grow into plants similar to those whence they
came. On account of their animal-like movements
they are called zoospores.</p>

<p>The formation of zoospores may be easily observed
in the brown sea weed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus Siliculosus</i> we
have already mentioned. This plant, as we have
already remarked, consists of thin, thread-like rows
of single cells and from time to time it is branched.
At certain periods of the year, moderately large,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
pear shaped swellings occur on the threads of the
sea-weed. If we are either fortunate or exceptionally
patient we may chance to be examining one of
these swellings under the microscope at the moment
when it bursts and sets free its contents. Should
we have this good fortune we must hasten to
magnify more highly the zoospores which have
escaped from the pear shaped spore case. Here we
may add the caution that we shall only witness the
bursting of the spore case if we examine our specimen
in sea water; we should require more than
the patience of Job to watch for its bursting in the
dry state, for it will never come to pass.</p>

<p>A careful study of a zoospore will show that it
swims in a peculiar manner. One of the little whips
is directed forwards, the other trails behind. After
a short period of activity the zoospore comes to
rest, loses all means of propulsion, germinates and
grows into a new <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus</i> plant.</p>

<p>Sometimes this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i> reaches a low ebb of vitality,
it requires a new lease of life as it were, when this
state is reached another form of increase takes place.
The events in this case may also be witnessed under
the microscope. From very similar spore cases a
number of zoospores are liberated and for a time
they swim about freely. If now we watch carefully
we shall notice that one of the active little bodies
comes to rest and that the others lose no time in
swarming round it. One of these swarming zoospores
fuses with the individual which first ceased
swimming about, with the result that a much larger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
non-swimming individual is formed which, after a
short resting period, germinates and grows into a
new sea weed. The remainder of the zoospores will
come to rest later and germinate to form new plants
just as though no fusion had taken place with two
of their number. Here we see the beginnings of
male and female increase amongst sea weeds; the
individual which first comes to rest is looked upon
as the female and the one with which it fuses as
the male.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Amongst the Wracks, of which there are a number
of kinds, the methods of increase reach a higher
stage. First of all let us describe the plants, so
that we may know what to look for. They all
belong to the group of brown <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>. The &#8220;Channelled
Wrack&#8221; is, when fully grown, about six
inches long. It is much branched, often almost
yellowish in colour and grows just below high-water
mark. Along one side of the plant there is a
moderately deep groove. Here we may note that the
Wracks grow in zones from just below high water
mark to low water mark. A little nearer the sea than
the haunts of the Channelled Wrack, we shall find the
Flat and Bladder Wracks. The former is but six
inches or so in length, with flat, forked fronds, along
the centres of which runs a single rib. The Bladder
Wrack varies considerably in size. It may be
smaller than either of the Wracks we have already
mentioned or it may be two or three feet in length.
It is the one seaweed familiar to everybody. Nearer
to low tide mark we shall encounter the Knobbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Wrack, greenish brown in colour and often as much
as six feet in length. It is so named because from
the sides of its flat, leathery, strap-like fronds, there
arise little stalked bladders. Right at, and often
beyond, low tide mark there dwells the Notched
Wrack; very similar to, though larger than, the
Flat Wrack, from which it may easily be distinguished
by the fact that the edges of its fronds are
toothed, after the manner of a saw.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the structure of any one of
these Wracks is much more complicated than is the
case with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus</i>. The latter Alga was composed
of a number of cells, similar to one another
in every respect except size. If we tease a stem
or a frond of one of the Wracks upon a slide and
examine the result of our efforts under the microscope
we shall see that the cells which compose the
Wrack are not by any means similar to one another.
Those of us who have mastered the, by no means
difficult, art of section cutting, should cut sections
of stem and frond and compare them with sections
of leaf and stem of some higher plant. The comparison
will show us that, although the seaweed
does not exhibit the complicated structure of a
flowering plant, it has at least three kinds of different
cells&mdash;an outer layer, a central structure and
an intermediate layer.</p>

<p>If we secure a specimen of the Channelled Wrack,
at the end of the summer, we shall notice that the
tips of certain of the fronds are swollen. Examination
of these swellings under a low magnification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
will reveal a number of wart-like structures, and
at the end of each wart there is a little pore. If
we open up one of these little warts, very carefully
with our mounted needles, we shall find that each
little pore opens into a cavity, within which we can
find two kinds of structures, hidden amongst a
number of hair like growths. We shall see a number
of dark, oval bodies, at the base of the hairs, these
are the egg cells; more careful search will show us
a number of much branched structures also partly
concealed by the hairs, these are the male organs
of the plants. The purpose of the hairs, by the way,
is to keep the little chamber moist, when the plant
is left high and dry. If we watch the pores of the
other warts carefully we may be fortunate enough
to see the process of increase taking place, for it
occurs outside the plant and not within the chamber.
The egg cell divides into two and its contents pass
out of the chamber by way of the pore; each cell
of the male organs gives rise to sixty-four oval little
structures, each provided with a pair of minute
whip-like threads by means of which it swims from
the chamber and goes in search of the egg cells.
Many of these little navigators are lost by the way
but one of them will reach and fuse with each egg
cell. After fusion the new-formed cell germinates
at once into a new Channelled Wrack.</p>

<p>That this is an advance is shown by the fact
that the little swimming bodies which fail to
fuse with the egg cell, do not develop into
new plants as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus</i> nor does the egg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cell, which has failed to fuse with a swimming body,
germinate.</p>

<p>In the Bladder Wrack, a very similar process takes
place. There are, however, certain important differences,
differences which show that the plant is
still more highly developed. If we examine the
cavities, in the little warts of the Bladder Wrack
we shall find that some of them contain egg cells,
some contain male organs but none contain both.
We noticed that the egg cell of the Channelled
Wrack produced two eggs, that of the Bladder
Wrack produces eight. In other respects the two
plants behave similarly.</p>

<p>The methods of increase amongst the red seaweeds
are rather more complicated and as our object is to
interest and not to puzzle our readers we will content
ourselves with a few general remarks. Microscopists
who are anxious to probe more deeply into the
subject will soon devise ways and means for themselves.
The little swimming bodies which lend an
added attraction to the study of the brown seaweeds
are replaced, amongst the red <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alg&aelig;</i>, by
organisms with but one whip-like structure apiece
and that without the power of propelling its owner
through the water. As with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectocarpus</i>, increase
may take place in two ways. On these red plants
we may find the now familiar swellings, which we
have learned to know are spore cases, but instead
of the multitudes of free swimming organisms which
are set free on the bursting of the brown sea weed
spore case, we now witness the expulsion of but four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
inert spores, which settle down in the water and
immediately grow into new plants.</p>

<p>In the second method of increase, where male and
female organs are concerned, we find that both
these structures grow on the outside of the plant
and not in cavities. Let us take the common, pink,
much branched seaweed, known by the fearsome
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callithamnion Corymbosum</i> as our example.
The male organs grow in little fungus like
tufts about the branches of the plant and they give
off enormous numbers of little organisms which have
no power of swimming to the female organs. Either
on the same or on another plant we shall find the
female organs; we need not describe them in detail
but there is one point of very great interest. From
each of the female organs there grows a long jelly-like
hair. As we have remarked, the organisms set
free by the male organs cannot swim about but float
aimlessly in the water. Obviously the majority of
them simply perish, one perchance may touch a
sticky hair to which it adheres, with which it fuses
and passes down to the female cell, resulting in the
production of a new seaweed.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that in writing about the
pollen grains of flowering plants, we mentioned that
those plants dependent upon wind for the distribution
of their pollen, have stigmas ingeniously
contrived for catching and retaining the grains. It
is curious that the red seaweeds should have very
similar contrivances for capturing and retaining the
male cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea will also provide us with a rich harvest
of those beautiful microscopic objects, the Diatoms.
They may be sought on seaweeds, their yellowish
brown colour often betrays their whereabouts, on
rocks and sand and in mud. The salt water forms
are as varied and as beautiful as their fresh water
cousins.</p>

<p>To the microscopist who merely uses his microscope
for the pleasure he can derive from it, rather
than for serious study, it may appear that
the plant life of the sea falls short of the animal
life as far as interest is concerned. He may disabuse
himself at once of this idea. There is no
class of plants more interesting than the seaweeds
and in few branches of plant life is there greater
scope for new discoveries. The garden of the sea
is largely an unexplored territory and there is no
coast-line in the world of equal extent which
provides so many different sea dwelling plants as
our own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICRO-TELESCOPE AND SUPER MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Those of our readers who have borne with us
thus far may quite excusably have thought
that the last word had been attained in the
construction of the microscope. It is true that different
makers have made various improvements to their
instruments, from time to time in recent years, most
of them of minor importance but useful in the aggregate.
But a few years ago, however, the advent of the
Micro-Telescope and Super-Microscope marked an
epoch in the manufacture of the microscope. We
have shown that great strides were made in scientific
investigation when the first simple lenses were manufactured,
that there was a lull in microscopic research
till the appearance of the compound microscope
and now, when the latest instruments are in
the hands of scientific workers, further possibilities
are opened up.</p>

<p>In all microscopes&mdash;the best as well as the cheaper
instruments&mdash;there is one failing which very early
forces itself upon the user. They have very little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
&#8220;depth of focus.&#8221; Let us explain exactly what the
phrase means. Once or twice in our pages, we have
recommended that the fine adjustment should be
rotated to and fro while certain objects are being
examined. When potato starch grains, for instance,
are magnified sufficiently highly to show their characteristic
markings, the whole of the grain cannot
be seen clearly at one time, because at that magnification
the &#8220;depth of focus&#8221; is slight. The higher
the magnification the less is the &#8220;depth of focus&#8221;;
when this quality is absent altogether only one
plane of an object can be viewed clearly without
re-adjusting the focus. With low magnifications,
we may, to a limited extent, have more than one
plane of an object in focus.</p>

<p>The same question of &#8220;depth of focus&#8221; occurs
in photography and perhaps an example showing
how it affects the camera user may make the matter
clearer. Suppose we wish to photograph a landscape
having, let us say, a tree in the foreground,
a cottage in the mid-distance and a hill in the distance.
If our lens is one of large aperture, that is
to say admits a considerable amount of light and
is also what is known as a long focus lens we shall
find, when we view the scene on the ground glass,
that when the tree is sharply focussed, the cottage
and hill are not clear. When we rack in the camera
to get the cottage sharply focussed, the tree and
hill will be un-sharp. Similarly when we focus on
the hill the tree and cottage remain out of focus.
The reason is that the lens in our case possesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
little &#8220;depth of focus.&#8221; The experienced landscape
photographer, did he wish all three objects to appear
equally sharp could easily attain his object. He
would perform the simple operation known as stopping
down his lens, that is to say he would gradually
close its diaphragm, while viewing the scene on the
ground glass. At a certain point everything would
be sharp, from foreground to distance. At the
smaller aperture of the lens, caused by closing the
diaphragm, the depth of focus would be considerably
increased, at the same time much less light
would be admitted to the camera. Looking upon
our object, under the microscope, as comparable
to a landscape, seen on the ground glass focussing
screen of a camera, it is obvious that, unless our
object has no thickness, and this is impossible, we
cannot highly magnify its upper and lower surfaces
at one and the same time. There are no adjustable
diaphragms in the objective so our only course is
to examine the two surfaces in turn or to resort to
a lower magnification.</p>

standpoint through the micro-telescope.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Apart from any other consideration, the super
microscope marks a big advance from the fact that
it possesses great &#8220;depth of focus.&#8221; It is possible,
for example, with this remarkable instrument to
examine a moss as it grows, with a high magnification
and see not a portion of a leaf or a fragment
of the stalk, as with the ordinary microscope, but
the whole upstanding plant, in stereoscopic relief.
It shows us objects exactly as we should see them
were we endowed with super eyes, enormously enlarged,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in relief and erect. Objects viewed through
this instrument are not inverted, as with the ordinary
microscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_242a.jpg" width="600" height="273" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A is the microscope proper and is, in all respects,
similar to the instrument with which we are familiar,
except that its mirror and condenser have been removed.
In the fitting provided for the condenser
a second microscope is arranged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_242b.jpg" width="600" height="213" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This consists of a tube D, an objective F, an ocular
C and an inner sliding tube E, the whole fits into
the metal case B, G is a stage on which the object
is placed and below G, if necessary, a condenser may
be fitted.</p>

<p>The instrument owes its remarkable magnifying
powers to the fact that the additional microscope
B, forms a magnified image of the object on the
stage G, at the opening in the stage of the microscope
A. This magnified image is still further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
enlarged by the original microscope. In other
words, the power of one microscope is employed on
that of another.</p>

<p>The apparatus as we have described it gives
enormous magnifications and it is possible, by using
a suitable combination of objectives, to obtain a
magnification of ten thousand diameters. Expressed
in non-technical language, a circle whose
actual diameter is equal to the thickness of the
paper upon which these words are printed, could be
so magnified by the super-microscope that it would
appear to be as thick as ten thousand similar
pieces of paper but, with this enormous magnification,
it is obvious that, even with such a marvellous
instrument, the whole of the circle from edge to
edge could not be seen at one time. With an ordinary
microscope a magnification of one thousand
three hundred diameters is considered highly satisfactory.
So that there is a great probability of
being able to see some of the minute objects which
are known to exist, but which have, up to the
present, eluded those who would view them, on
account of their minuteness. There is a possibility
also of discovering a new underworld of which no
man has yet dreamed. The man who uses his microscope
solely because of the pleasure he derives from
it, rather than he who uses it because it is essential
to his business or profession, will be more attracted
by the micro-telescope. By this we do not infer
that the instrument is not useful, as a fact it is of
the greatest importance in certain cases, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for Nature-study work, for the observation of
minerals and to the chemist.</p>

<p>Like its sister instrument, the micro-telescope consists
of an ordinary microscope to which is attached
a specially designed object glass in a tube, which
take the place of the condenser. The makers, indeed,
provide two of these object glasses&mdash;one for viewing
objects from one to two feet away, the other for
viewing objects from a distance of three feet to the
planets, if need be. Once when the instrument was
being tested some crumbs were placed on the floor
at a distance of four yards and strongly illuminated,
and the microscope with a 1-inch objective focussed
on the crumbs. With this objective in an ordinary
microscope the magnification would be about thirty
diameters. Presently some mice came out, and
made themselves at home with the crumbs. The
mice could be examined at this distance, without
their being aware of it, so well that individual hairs
were easily visible and about half a mouse was in
the field of view. In point of size each mouse
appeared about the same as a beaver within a foot
or two.</p>

<p>Messrs F. Davidson &amp; Co., 29 Great Portland
Street, London, are well known for the high state of
perfection to which they have brought the micro-telescope
and other instruments connected with
microscopy.</p>

<p>The novelty of the micro-telescope will appeal
strongly to the Nature lover. At a distance of a few
feet a spider can be magnified to the size of a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
cat, and it can be watched spinning its web with
spinnerettes the size of teacups. Ants at a distance
of six feet are seen to be fearsome individuals, six
inches in length, and their tiny burdens are so
magnified that they appear like yule logs or goodly-proportioned
boulders, according to their nature.
At a distance of ten feet a wasp may be seen
scraping tiny shavings of wood from oak palings
by means of its jaws&mdash;shavings which it converts
into paper for building its nest. Very small insects
may be observed as they come into the world from
their chrysalis stage. The never-tiring jaws of the
caterpillar may be seen at work devouring some
favourite leaf&mdash;the whole action of biting and
swallowing the vegetable matter can be plainly
seen. Such interesting events as the tending of
green flies by ants, the leaf-cutting habits of the
leaf-cutter bee, and a hundred and one other events
are all revealed by the micro-telescope and at such
a distance that the living objects are not disturbed
in their activities, being quite unaware that they
are under observation. To the botanist the instrument
is no less useful.</p>

<p>In various manufactures, such as ore smelting,
and in the manufacture of glass, china and pottery,
in enamelling and in certain engineering shops,
where it is necessary to examine material at a high
temperature, the micro-telescope is a great boon,
and, at least, is the means of avoiding considerable
physical discomfort. It is used also by architects
and surveyors for examining the condition of the factory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
chimneys, bridges, derricks and the like. To the
engineer the instrument is invaluable; we have explained
elsewhere how necessary it is that various
metals and mixtures of metals should be examined
for fractures. Under the high magnification with
the ordinary microscope, even with an instrument
specially designed for the work, only a very small
area can be studied at once. With the micro-telescope
a relatively large area may be examined
under a high magnifying power.</p>

<p>There are three features of this ingenious apparatus
which cannot fail to commend themselves equally
to the casual worker and the serious microscopist.
All objects are seen erect, just as the eye sees them.
This is brought about because, as in the case of the
super-microscope, we really observe a magnified,
inverted image of our object, formed at the spot
where the object would be placed were we using
an ordinary microscope. This image is inverted
once more in the microscope and so it appears to
us erect.</p>

<p>All objects appear in relief and in their proper
planes; this is seen in a striking manner by viewing
an ordinary photograph through the apparatus,
when the various parts stand out as in nature.
There is also enormous depth of focus. With the
attachment for viewing objects at a short distance,
the whole of a tubular shaped flower such as a
daffodil may be in focus at once, from the tip of
the petals to the bottom of the tube. With the
attachment designed for long distance work, objects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from twenty yards to sixty miles may be clearly
viewed at one and the same time.</p>

<p>A few of the unsolved problems confronting the
microscopist are reviewed in our <a href="#Page_291">concluding
chapter</a>. Whether they will ever be solved we dare
not venture to say; but, if they are to be, surely
to this latest arrival in the microscopic world and
to its companion, the super-microscope, the honours
will go.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="smallfont">CHEMISTRY AND THE MICROSCOPE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">To thoroughly comprehend the various uses to
which the chemist may put his microscope, it
is necessary to have a knowledge of chemistry.
The science is so wide in its scope that no single
chapter could do justice to it. There are analytical
chemists, scientists whose aim is to find out the
composition of various substances; biological
chemists who deal with the many problems of life
in which chemistry plays a part, but we need not
attempt to detail all the branches of this highly
specialised science.</p>

<p>Chemical analysis is founded upon the fact that
when certain chemicals are mixed together they
will, or they may, unite to form quite a different
chemical. This newly formed chemical is probably
a different colour to the substances which were used
in its making, or again the original chemicals may
be soluble in water and the new chemical insoluble,
in which case it will form a cloudiness known as
a precipitate. An example may help to make our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
description clearer. Suppose we take some common
table salt and dissolve it in a little water in a
glass, then add to this a little solution of nitrate
of silver, which is sold under the name of lunar
caustic, we shall find that a white cloudiness is
formed when the liquids mix, although originally
they were both clear. The reason of this cloudiness
is that the two substances, dissolved in water have
united with one another to form a third substance
which will not dissolve, therefore it settles down as
a fine powder. Long experience has taught analytical
chemists exactly what chemicals to add to
test for all the common substances, by the formation
of these precipitates; so that, if any powder
were given to one of these scientists he could tell
its composition by applying certain tests. In this
chemical analysis considerable quantities are required
and it is often necessary to test very small
samples, so small that the ordinary methods are
out of the question. This is where the microscope
scores, because with this wonderful instrument,
only drops are required and tests of corresponding
delicacy may be made; in fact, by modern microscopic
methods it is possible to detect the presence
of as little as ten thousandth part of a grain of
arsenic, or quicksilver or of the deadly poisons,
Strychnine or Prussic Acid.</p>

<p>In testing for poisons the microscope is invaluable.
Frequently only the most minute traces of the
poison occur in the system and the modern microscopist
who makes a study of poisons and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
detection can solve mysteries which would have
baffled all the scientists in the world in days gone
by.</p>

<p>Our chemical studies with the microscope may
well begin with various common crystals; they are
usually easy to prepare; the process of crystallization
is always interesting to watch, and as objects
for the microscope it would be difficult to find anything
more beautiful than these home-made gems.
All crystals should be examined by reflected as well
as by transmitted light. When we are working
with the former lighting, a piece of black paper
beneath the slide will help to show up the objects
to better advantage.</p>

<p>The easiest method of obtaining crystals of any
substance which is soluble in water is to make a
saturated solution in this liquid, to put a small
drop upon a slide, then to tilt the microscope
slightly so that there is a thin film of solution at the
upper side of the drop. The microscope must not
be tilted so much that the liquid runs from the slide
on to the stage. Where the film of liquid is thin
crystals will be found first. A word of explanation
is necessary concerning the term saturated solution,
especially as we may have occasion to use it many
times. When we add a solid to a liquid in which
it is soluble, we shall find that the liquid
will take up a certain amount of the solid
and no more; when, on the addition of more
solid it fails to dissolve, we have reached the
saturation point. A saturated solution then is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a liquid in which the maximum amount of solid
is dissolved.</p>

<p>We have already described the most simple way
in which crystals may be formed, and we may easily
make objects for our microscope in this manner of
all the substances we can find which are soluble in
water. With some we shall find that crystals do
not form easily, in which event we may modify our
tactics and warm one drop of saturated solution on
the slide till nearly all the moisture is driven off,
then there should be no difficulty in watching the
crystals in process of formation. Common salt,
sugar, alum, borax, washing soda, iron sulphate,
called also green vitriol and copper sulphate, or blue
vitriol, are common and easily obtained substances,
all soluble in water. As we carry our experiments
a little further we shall find that crystals formed
from cold solutions as suggested in our first method
differ from those formed from hot solutions. Again,
if we use some other substance than water as our
solvent the crystals which separate out will differ
once more. Many very interesting experiments may
be tried on these lines.</p>

<p>Many beautiful crystals may be obtained by dissolving
various substances in gelatine or gum. The
method is simple. Gently warm a little gelatine,
to which is added an equal volume of water, in a
chemist&#8217;s test-tube. When the gelatine has all dissolved
make a saturated solution of the substance,
from which crystals are derived. Green or blue vitriol
are good subjects for the experiment. Add a little of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the saturated solution to the gelatine and stir with
a glass rod, taking care to avoid the formation of
air bubbles. A little of the mixture may now be
placed in a thin film on a slide covered with a cover
slip and left to cool. Examination when cool under
the microscope will show lovely fern-like crystals,
whose beauty rivals that of ice crystals familiar to
us on our window panes during hard weather in the
winter. Barium chloride also produces very beautiful
fern-like crystals when treated in this manner.
Chlorate of potash, familiar to most of us as a
remedy for sore throat, forms crystals totally dissimilar
to those substances we have named. Having
made as many crystals as we wish from water and
also from gelatine solutions, we may turn our attention
to gum arabic. The method of obtaining
crystals from this substance is exactly similar to
that described for gelatine except, of course, that
we substitute gum for gelatine. This work is of the
greatest interest, for not only does it yield wonderfully
beautiful objects for our microscope, but it is
a hobby full of surprises. When we are about to
examine a new crystal for the first time we can
never so much as hazard what shape it will assume.
Sugar, it may be mentioned, does not crystallize
at once from a saturated solution in water, and the
best method of obtaining the crystals is to warm
the slide, on which we have placed a drop of solution,
and then when dry to set aside for a day; at
the end of that time, especially if the air be moist,
the crystals will have formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall find it interesting to try experiments in
mixing two different substances, then we shall probably
obtain crystals totally unlike those of either
of the ingredients. As an example of this method,
let us make a saturated solution of a mixture of blue
vitriol and magnesium sulphate in water. Place a
drop of the solution on a slide, heat over a flame,
not only till dry, but till the substance left on the
slide begins to melt. We must use every care not
to crack the slide, and this may best be accomplished
by keeping it moving while over the flame. Now if
we watch our object through our microscope we can
witness the formation of wonderful feathery crystals,
as the slide cools.</p>

<p>Some strikingly beautiful results may be obtained
in another manner; the method is used by analysts
in their so-called fusion tests. We take a small grain
of some substance, say, lead nitrate, place it in the
centre of our slide, cover with a cover slip, and warm
over a flame till it melts. Then, taking a similar-sized
grain of another substance, such as saltpetre,
we place it against the edge of the cover slip on the
side opposite to the lead nitrate. Further warming
will cause the saltpetre to melt, and run below the
slide and mix with the lead nitrate. If we watch
the meeting of the two chemicals a wonderful sight
will reward us. The lead compound forms a
&#8220;beautiful crystalline skeleton,&#8221; whilst the saltpetre
forms six-sided stars at the opposite side of the cover
slip. The experiment may be repeated, using lunar
caustic and saltpetre, also the iodides of silver and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
potassium; in fact we may try any chemical substances
we have at hand, though we shall find that
some do not melt very easily, and potassium chlorate
is somewhat dangerous, for it forms explosive compounds
with certain substances.</p>

<p>The number of interesting and beautiful objects
which may be obtained by so-called solution tests is
practically unlimited, and the enthusiastic microscopist
will certainly try all the tests we describe
as well as many others of his own invention. Should
the chemist wish to detect the presence of aluminium
in very small quantities, he relies on his microscope
and proceeds in the following manner. He takes a
drop of the solution, suspected of containing alum,
and adds to it a drop of sulphuric acid. This
mixture he puts on his slide, which he heats over
a flame till dry. Now he adds a drop of water, and
then a very small amount of calcium chloride is
brought to the edge of the water. Beneath his
microscope he can now watch the formation of
beautiful colourless, eight-sided crystals which
denote the presence of aluminium.</p>

<p>A word of warning is necessary concerning this
and the following experiments; they may not
always succeed, for success largely depends upon
having the solutions at the right strength, and
experience alone can teach us what is correct.
Interesting and easily formed crystals may be
obtained from barium sulphate, and the experiment
may also be made to show the phenomenon which
we have already mentioned, that the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
crystals depends on the nature of their solution.
A little barium sulphate should be dissolved in
strong sulphuric acid. Here, by the way, another
warning: every care should be taken in the use
of all acids; they should never be allowed to come
into contact with face, hands or clothes, nor should
they touch any part of the microscope. Some acids
give off fumes, and these should not be allowed to
reach the eyes or nose, and the microscope must be
protected from them. To continue our experiment:
While hot a drop of the solution of barium sulphate
in sulphuric acid should be transferred by means of
a glass rod to a slide and allowed to cool. Examination
with the microscope will show that the barium
sulphate has formed small rectangular scales. With
the remainder of the sulphuric acid we now make a
saturated solution of barium sulphate, and find, on
repeating the method described above, that the
chemical has formed curious x-shaped crystals.
Similar experiments may be tried with calcium sulphate
with the certainty of interesting results.</p>

<p>Many crystals of calcium, in the form of calcium
oxalate, may be found in plants, and they are well
worth looking for. They may best be seen in sections
of the plants, but, if we have not mastered the art
of cutting sections, we may find them by teasing the
plant cells apart with our mounted needles. In the
stems of rhubarb there is the substance in bundles
of long needle-shaped crystals, to which the name
of raphides has been given. In the seed of the
garden poppy, just below the skin, there is a layer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
known as the crystal layer, where crystals of calcium
oxalate occur as tiny balls called crystal sand. In
the leaf stalks of begonias very beautiful and
occasionally very large crystals of this substance may
be found, whilst in shapes they are strikingly varied.
In orris root there are enormous crystals of calcium
oxalate; in fact it is common in many plants.</p>

<p>If we have a photographic friend who will supply
us with quite a small quantity of gold chloride, we
shall be in a position to try three most interesting
experiments and to obtain some curious crystals.
We require a very weak solution of gold chloride in
water, not more than 3.5 per cent. for our first
experiment. Mix one drop of this solution with the
same quantity of hydrochloric acid on a slide and
heat over a flame till dry. The microscope will now
show us probably the most curious crystals we have
ever examined; some are long, some short, and some
a zigzag in form; mixed with these there will be
a few flat plate-like crystals with rectangular projections.
All these curious crystals are yellow.</p>

<p>If instead of hydrochloric acid we use a solution
of common salt in water and repeat the experiment
as before, we shall obtain pale yellow prisms and
some crystals of common salt. Gold is costly, so it
is perhaps lucky that one of the tests for this rare
metal is one of the most delicate known to chemists;
it is possible, in fact, to detect very minute quantities
of gold. For this experiment we may take an
exceedingly weak solution of gold chloride and place
a drop on our slide; we also require a solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
chloride of tin, known as stannous chloride, in an
evil smelling liquid called chlorine water. If now
we watch our drop of gold solution under the microscope,
and while watching mix with it a drop of
stannous chloride solution, a strikingly beautiful
purple colouration is produced&mdash;this purple has been
named the purple of Cassius.</p>

<p>If we desire further experiments in the testing
of common substances, and incidentally in the production
of beautiful crystals, we might do worse
than try the effect of adding a solution of platinum
chloride to any solution containing a compound of
potassium. Charmingly beautiful crystals will
result.</p>

<p>The experiments we have described as well as
hundreds of others are used by analysts every
day in the testing of various substances. We have
started in every case by knowing what our solutions
contain; the duty of the analyst is to discover what
he has before him. Given an unlimited quantity of
a substance for testing purposes it is not always
easy to determine its composition. With very small
quantities, perhaps less than a tea-spoon full in all,
the difficulties of the analyst are increased tenfold
and without the assistance of the microscope his
efforts would be unavailing, he deals in drops and
every drop is precious. Sad to relate this form of
testing, known to science as micro-chemical analysis,
has been practised to a far greater extent on the
continent than in this country.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who wish to try the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
we have described for themselves can obtain
all the necessary substances, except the poisons, at
any chemists and the quantities required will only
be the smallest that can be obtained, in fact any
reasonable-minded chemist would probably let a
microscopist whom he knew have a few grains of
a large number of chemical substances, suitable for
this work, at the outlay of a few pence. The
chlorides of gold and platinum we fear no one will
give away.</p>

<p>All the experiments we have described thus far
have necessitated the use of what are called inorganic
substances, they may be described in every
day language as substances derived from the inanimate
world. There are many equally interesting
tests which may be carried out with animal
and vegetable products.</p>

<p>Formic acid is the substance which renders the
sting of ants so painful; it may, however, be prepared
artificially and if a little, dissolved in water,
is mixed with a solution of silver nitrate we shall
obtain flat plate like crystals also some resembling
fine fibres.</p>

<p>Probably the most curious of the easily obtained
crystals from vegetable products, may be made
from citric acid which occurs in lemons. If a little
of the acid be mixed with a solution of caustic soda
and boiled with calcium chloride, a drop of the
liquid after boiling placed on a slide will give
crystals readily. When viewed from above they
are an elongated oval shape, described by some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
authorities as resembling a whetstone. Viewed
from the side they have a striking similarity to small
sheaves of wheat.</p>

<p>With the recognition of poisons under the microscope
we need not trouble ourselves here. It would
be useless to describe any of the experiments, for
few of us could obtain such deadly substances as
nicotine, strychnine, aconite, morphia and the like.
Nevertheless the recognition of these and similar
substances in very minute quantities is rendered
easy, to those who have the necessary knowledge,
by means of the microscope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE USE OF THE MICROSCOPE IN MANUFACTURES</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">In how many branches of commerce, we wonder,
does the microscope play its part. It is used in
several departments of engineering for examining
steels and many other metals not only for defects
but to see how they are made up. It is used in
brewing for studying the various yeasts and other
substances, including the hops which go to the
making of beer. All manufactures which depend
upon fermentation, such as wine and vinegar
making, are largely dependent upon the work of
the microscope. In dairy work the microscope is
invaluable. In the examination of various fabrics
the assistance of the microscope is always summoned.
Paper manufacture and paper testing give
work for the microscopist but it would, we think,
be easier to give a list of the branches of commerce
in which the microscope is not used than to
attempt to enumerate those which make use of
the instrument.</p>

<p>We cannot possibly describe all the uses to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the microscope is put, so we will confine ourselves
to one or two of the more important and, at the
same time, to those which can, for the most part
be repeated at home.</p>

<p>The two most important commodities for mankind
are food and clothing; we cannot live without
food and those of us who take but little pride in
our appearance, must have clothing of some sort.
We have said a little about food in another chapter
and there we have also mentioned the impurities
which find their way, by accident or design, into
some of the commoner foods.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will deal first of all with
clothing describing how many of the raw materials
may be recognised under the microscope and showing
very briefly how fraud in connection with the
manufacture of wearing apparel is detected. Practically
all clothing is made from animal or vegetable
fibres, some, however, is made of artificial fibres
and these we shall mention.</p>

<p>The vegetable fibres used in the manufacture of
wearing apparel are all either hairs or what are
called bast fibres and the latter, in non-scientific
language, may be described as the strands which
run through the roots and stems of most plants.
The chief requirements of vegetable fibres, destined
to be woven into fabrics, are strength, it is
obvious that a weak fibre would be useless; length,
the longer the fibre the better and as we shall see
later, short fibres are often made up into inferior
material; pliability, a stiff fibre would make an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
uncomfortable fabric; firmness and durability.
Animal fibres used in the manufacture are either
hairs or silk.</p>

<p>The most important vegetable fibre is cotton, it
consists of the hairs from the seed coats of several
species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gossypium</i>, a plant closely related to our
common mallow. There are very many different
kinds of cotton and the qualities of the fibres of
these different cottons vary tremendously. Each
hair is one cell and more or less spindle shaped,
that is to say, thicker towards the middle than at
the base. If we can obtain a little raw cotton we
should certainly examine it under the microscope;
this may best be done by laying one or two fibres
in a drop of water on a slide. Under the low
power, the first thing that will attract our attention
is the fact that the fibres are twisted, corkscrew
fashion, though not regularly nor throughout
their whole length. This curious twisting makes
raw cotton easily recognised and it is, at the same
time, a very valuable peculiarity of these plant
hairs. The greater the number of twists and the
greater their regularity, the more valuable the cotton
becomes for weaving purposes. Under a higher
magnification, we recognise other characteristics of
the cotton fibre. Each fibre is somewhat flattened,
its edges are thick and, running up the centre, there
is a fairly broad lumen, as it is called. Covering
the whole there is a skin which by the
way is often wanting in the fibres of cotton
fabric owing to the chemicals with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
raw cotton has been treated and also to the
methods of manufacture.</p>

<p>A very striking experiment may be tried by
soaking a few cotton fibres in cuprammonia, a substance
prepared by the action of ammonia solution
on copper filings. Constrictions occur at fairly
regular intervals along the fibre so that, after treatment
with cuprammonia, the cotton fibres resemble
strings of little beads.</p>

<p>The manufacture of mercerised cotton has become
very important of late years. The process is named
after its inventor, Mercer, and consists in removing
the skin from the fibres, causing them to untwist
and, by doing so, to impart to them a lustre of
silk. We may make a little mercerised cotton for
examination under the microscope by soaking some
raw fibres for a short time in a solution of caustic
soda or caustic potash and then washing them in
water to which a little acid has been added. This
will cause the fibres to untwist and also destroy the
skin, but we shall probably notice that the fibres
have shrunk. In the process of manufacture precautions
are taken to prevent this shrinking for then
the lustre is much better. We shall also observe
that in our mercerised fibres the lumen has become
very narrow and it is often broken, here and there
are swellings on the outside of each fibre, corresponding
to the positions of the twists. Mercerised
cotton, in addition to its lustre, is stronger and
absorbs dyes more easily than ordinary cotton.</p>

<p>Flax consists of the bast fibres of the flax plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Examination of the raw product under the microscope
will reveal both long and short fibres. The
former are the more valuable and are used in the
manufacture of linen, the latter are made into tow.
The long fibres, which are derived from the upper
parts of the flax plant have thickened edges and
a very small lumen. The short fibres, used for
making tow, come from the lower part of the
stem and the roots of the plant. Each fibre has
a broad lumen and is very similar to hemp fibre.
Examination of all these fibres, by the way, is best
made in water as described under cotton.</p>

<p>Hemp is another bast fibre and as we have
remarked it resembles the short fibres of flax;
there is a broad lumen with an indistinct margin.
If we have an opportunity of comparing these fibres
under the microscope we shall see that many of
those of hemp have forked ends. This is very characteristic
of the plant and is never found in flax,
therefore it affords a ready means of distinguishing
hemp from flax. Fine linen should never contain
hemp, so that if our object be to test the quality
of a sample of linen by microscopic examination,
we must keep a sharp look out for the forked fibres
of hemp. In coarse linen these fibres occur for
hemp is used in its manufacture.</p>

<p>Jute, another important fibre is readily distinguished
under the microscope, for its margins have
perfectly smooth walls and its lumen is wide in
some places, narrow in others and interrupted
altogether in places.</p>

<p>There are an extraordinary number of vegetable
fibres which are woven into articles of commerce,
of one kind and another. Then again, many fibres
are so short or so brittle that they cannot be woven
but are used for other purposes such as filling
cushions, cheap bedding, etc. There are also a
certain number of vegetable fibres which are valuable
because they are stiff and bristle-like as well
as durable, and they are used for brushes, door
mats and for similar purposes. To the microscopist
who is interested in this work there is a wide field
open.</p>

<p>For the examination of paper, which may be
described as a &#8220;felt of finely divided fibres,&#8221; the
microscope is invaluable. The essentials of a good
paper are that it be durable, that it retain its colour
and not become brittle. The least observant of us
cannot fail to have noticed that there are an extraordinary
number of different kinds of paper, not
only the many kinds which the paper manufacturers
could show us, but the obviously varied
papers which we meet with every day. Added to
the papers, there are cardboards which are really
a kind of paper. It is clear, therefore, that
the man who can tell us exactly how any and every
paper is made and what it is made of has laid up
a goodly store of knowledge. In carrying out tests
of paper we rely partly on chemical and partly on
microscopic tests.</p>

<p>A number of substances contribute to the manufacture
of paper; linen and cotton rags, hemp and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
various fibres are the most commonly used, not
forgetting wood pulp which we shall mention in a
moment. The finest and whitest paper is made
from linen rags and that from unused linen and
hemp is the strongest. Without attempting to
describe in detail or even in outline the different
processes which the various vegetable fibres must
undergo before they appear in the guise of paper,
we may say the treatment is very drastic. Strong
chemicals and machinery designed to reduce the
fibre to the finest possible particles render the
examination of paper, for the purpose of discovering
its composition, far from easy. Such fibres as
survive the rough treatment are mere fragments yet
they are often large enough for the lynx eyed microscope
to read their story. Formerly the constituents
of most papers could be separated into three classes
according to their behaviour with iodine solution,
but this test has been superseded by more complicated
methods which do not concern us here.</p>

<p>The examination of various papers may prove
interesting for example in linen rag paper, we ought
to find some flax fibres, they will be sadly battered
and torn but are usually recognisable under
the microscope. Hemp paper is tough and is used
for bank notes, in it some of the short tow fibres
will probably occur and they will give a clue to its
composition. Cotton rag paper is easily recognised
for the fibres are very characteristic, a remark which
also applies to jute paper, the so-called manila used
for envelopes, wrappers, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Mechanical wood pulp which enters so largely
into the manufacture of paper is easily recognised
by those who have given a fair amount of attention
to the microscopical examination of plant life.
Wood pulp is always used in conjunction with some
binding material such as cotton or flax fibres. Many
different kinds of wood are converted into pulp and
of course it requires a considerable amount of experience
to say exactly what kind of wood has been
used in a certain paper. Some of the woods are
poplars of various kinds, others spruces and firs.
It is easy to distinguish the conifers as spruces and
firs are called, for the reason that the trees bear
cones. The little fragments of wood, scattered
throughout the paper, have minute circular perforations
upon them, resembling miniature quoits, if
they belong to the conifers; none of the other woods
possess these &#8220;pits&#8221; as they are called.</p>

<p>Very many other plant remains may be found
in paper, for instance hop fibres are used sometimes
and their presence is usually shown by remnants
of the climbing hooks which, during life, studded
the climbing stem of the hop.</p>

<p>Some of the important animal hairs, used in the
manufacture of clothing, may now claim our attention.
Wool and silk are of course the most important.
The best wool is all obtained from the
domestic sheep so let us examine one or two of the
easily obtained hairs from this animal. As with
the vegetable fibres we may examine them in a drop
of water but, in this case, we shall find that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
cannot make the water go near the wool for the
reason that the latter is covered with a film of
grease, called wool fat. Our first care, therefore,
it to get rid of the wool fat and this may be done
by shaking the specimen with a little ether or
chloroform.</p>

<p>Having cleaned the wool fibres we may proceed
to examine them under a high magnification and,
to see their structure fully, we must move the fine
adjustment to and fro, for it is not possible to
obtain a true idea of its structure without doing
so. We shall see that the hair consists of two
layers, an outer skin and an inner core. The latter
consists of a number of cells, whilst the former is
composed of scales, of which the lower edges are
arranged beneath the upper edges of the previous
scales, like tiles on a roof. The free edges of the
scales project outwards a little so that the wool,
when not so highly magnified, appears to have a
toothed margin. Further examination will show us
that no single scale completely envelops the strand
of wool, usually two scales make the complete
circuit. It is a curious and easily tested phenomenon
that in say an inch of wool from the same
kind of sheep there are always the same number
or very nearly the same number of scales. By
counting the scales, experts can tell from what
animal the wool is derived.</p>

<p>If we examine many samples of wool we shall
not be long before we encounter certain specimens
showing one or more constrictions. Now we all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
know that the reason why some people do not grow
very much is because they are delicate, ill health
affects the whole system. The constrictions in the
sheep&#8217;s wool occur because the animal has suffered
from some illness, or from great hunger or thirst,
which has resulted in its wool not growing properly
for a period corresponding to the duration of the
illness or other calamity.</p>

<p>The examination of various animal hairs will help
to while away many an hour and many of these
objects are of the greatest interest. If we have the
opportunity it will be interesting to compare the
wool from different kinds of sheep, that from the
Lincoln sheep, for example differs from that of
shortwooled kinds. We may also compare goat&#8217;s
wool with sheep&#8217;s, then there are differences between
the hair of cows and calves. Comparisons
always make microscopic work more interesting.</p>

<p>The microscopic examination of cloth, used for
making our coats, is quite interesting work and
withal important. A good deal of the cloth which
is made up into suits is known as shoddy, that is
to say that material that has been worn before;
old rags of all sorts and many other extraordinary
things go to the making of this cloth. There are
special factories to which rags are sent to be made
up into shoddy. One might think therefore that
this substance would be easily recognised under the
microscope but it is not quite so easy as we shall
see. Absolutely pure wool from the sheep giving the
best quality wool is only used in the very finest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and most expensive fabrics. In a great deal of
really good cloth we may recognise other hairs
besides those of the sheep and sometimes vegetable
fibres find their way into good cloth by accident.
A piece of suspected cloth should be cut off and
separated as far as possible into its different
fibres. In shoddy we shall find few long fibres and
they will all be much torn for the reason that the
rags from which the material is made are cut up
in the manufacture. If we find cotton fibres, we
may be certain that our specimen is shoddy, also
if we can find fibres of many different colours,
though the final dyeing may have disguised the fact
that the fibres have originally figured in fabrics
of various colours.</p>

<p>Silk is one of the most important of all fibres
capable of being woven into fabric. It is hardly
necessary to remark that it is formed by the
fully fed silkworm just before it turns into a
chrysalis. A very large number of caterpillars spin
silk but the majority of this silk is useless for
commercial purposes. The silkworm gives off a
double thread of silk from glands in its mouth and,
at the same time, it gives off a sticky substance
called silk glue which sticks the two fibres together,
so that, to the eye at least they appear as
one fibre.</p>

<p>Most of us have kept silkworms, those who have
not may find it worth while to expend a few pence
in some of these insects for the sake of examining
the raw silk. A cocoon, as the work of the caterpillar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
is called, consists of three layers, an outer
layer of floss, a middle layer and a so-called layer
(the inner layer) of parchment. Only the middle
layer is used in commerce, the floss is too fine and
weak and the parchment is so impregnated with
silk glue as to be useless.</p>

<p>If we examine some raw silk, taken from the
middle layer of a cocoon, we can easily see the two
parallel fibres of silk and the outer wrinkled covering
of silk glue. Now, magnifying our object more
highly, we shall see that each fibre is a solid rod,
with a smooth lustrous surface and without any
sign of lumen or cell structure; the rods too are
continuous and this alone distinguishes silk from
all other fibres animal or vegetable. Two tests are
worth trying for they are characteristic of silk. On
the addition of a little strong sulphuric acid we
observe that the silk rapidly dissolves, on the other
hand, if a few fibres are boiled in hydrochloric
acid, the silk dissolves but the envelope of silk glue
remains unchanged and appears beneath the microscope
as a cracked and wrinkled tube.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of another moth spins coarser
greyish coloured fibres, which are spun into the
well known Tussore silk. As with the common
silkworm these caterpillars spin two fibres and glue
them together with silk glue. In this case, however,
under a high magnification we shall notice
that the fibres are marked with a number of very
fine lines running lengthways, whilst every now
and then there are fairly deep indentations. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
former markings are natural to the fibres, the
latter are caused by one fibre being pressed against
the other. In countries where the production of
silk is of great importance, the microscope is not
only pressed into service for examining the product
of these useful little insects, but also in keeping
watch for a very deadly disease which attacks the
caterpillars. It is called &#8220;pebrine&#8221; and the great
scientist Pasteur, whose name is world famous for
his work on bacteriology, discovered that it was
caused by a tiny fungus.</p>

<p>Artificial silk is an important article of commerce.
It is made in several different ways and of various
substances. Some artificial silk is made of collodion,
some again is made of cellulose the substance
of which the cell walls of young plants is composed;
gelatine is also used in making this commodity.
As a rule it is easy to distinguish artificial
from real silk, for usually the imitation consists of
flat fibres or at least fibres quite different to the
smooth rods of real silk. The iodine test is often
sufficient indication, for with this chemical true
silk is coloured brown.</p>

<p>Space or lack of it does not allow us to describe
how the microscope may be and is applied to other
manufactures, even the miller uses the instrument,
for it will tell him if his flour is of pure wheat, and
in this manner. He puts a little flour in a drop of
water on a slide and covers with a cover slip; then,
for a moment or two, he rubs the cover glass to
and fro over the water and flour and examines his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
specimen under the microscope. If his flour be of
wheat, he will see fairly stout spindle shaped
strings, if it be of rye no strings appear, whilst
maize flour gives very small strings. These are
called gluten strings and wheat is very rich in
gluten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE MICROSCOPE AND CAMERA ALLIED</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Photography is such a popular hobby in
these days, that the enthusiast who possesses
both camera and microscope, is certain,
sooner or later, to wish to take permanent records
of some of the beautiful objects revealed to him by
the latter instrument. The production of high-power
photo-micrographs, as the pictures of highly magnified
objects are called, can only be carried out by
those who are skilled in the use of both camera
and microscope and are possessed of considerable
patience. There is nothing to prevent any amateur
photographer who possesses a bellows camera&mdash;box
cameras cannot be used for this work&mdash;from producing
excellent low-power photo-micrographs, that
is to say pictures of objects less highly magnified.</p>

<p>It may be disappointing to learn that a microscope
is not necessary for this work. The requirements
are, a camera which will open out to a
considerable extent and a short focus lens. Before
we show how the pictures may be taken, we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
be quite clear what is meant by a short focus lens.
There are various ways of measuring the focus of
a lens; in the case of a single lens the operation
is fairly simple, but single lenses are made of one
glass and most camera lenses are built up of several
pieces of glass, then it is much more difficult to
measure the focus quite accurately. For ordinary
purposes and for our purpose, it is only necessary
to know the focus in round figures and to do so we
open up the camera and focus some distant object
on the ground glass, then the distance in inches
from the back of the lens to the ground glass will
give us very nearly the correct focus, or as it is
often called focal length, of our lens. Suppose we
focus on a church steeple a mile away and then find
that a space of five inches separates the back of
our lens from the ground glass, the lens is of five
inches focal length.</p>

<p>With a lens of such a focal length we shall require
a camera with very long bellows to obtain much
magnification of our object but, if our camera is
one with only short bellows, we can still overcome
our difficulties. If the extra expense is no object
we can obtain one of the excellent Aldis lenses of
only two inches focal length, especially designed
for this work; if we are ingenious we can construct
a device which will answer our purpose
admirably and cost but a few pence. With the
simple apparatus we are about to describe photo-micrographs
up to ten diameters magnification can
be obtained in most cameras. The term, ten diameters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
may appear puzzling but really it is quite
simple. Suppose we wish to make a photo-micrograph
of a penny stamp and we wish it to be
magnified ten diameters, we should require a large
camera for the operation, but that, for the moment,
is beside the point. Our penny stamp, magnified
ten diameters, would be equal in area to ten
horizontal rows of stamps, each row containing ten
stamps or, in other words, it would occupy the
same area as one hundred penny stamps.</p>

<p>To find the magnification possible with our
camera and lens, extend the camera bellows to the
full and set up a foot rule in front of the lens.
Move the camera from a distance slowly towards
the rule till it is sharply focussed, then carefully
measure the distance between the inch lines on the
focussing screen; if the lines are three inches apart
we shall be able to make photo-micrographs three
times the size of our object and we shall probably
desire something better.</p>

<p>To obtain a considerably magnified picture we
must have a lens of short focal length and a
camera with long bellows, in fact in theory the
amount of magnification is only limited by the
length of the bellows, so that an extraordinarily
long camera should give us a much magnified
picture. We cannot lengthen our bellows without
considerable expense, but we can shorten the focal
length of our lens. If we obtain, at the cost of
a few pence, a convex lens of short focal length,
such as is used in cheap magnifiers we can easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
apply it to our camera lens and it will have the
effect of shortening its focus. This extra lens can
either be fitted in front of our original lens by
cutting two inches of cardboard, of such a size that
they will just fit into the lens hood. In the centre
of each piece of cardboard, cut two circles, slightly
smaller in diameter than the diameter of the
convex lens. Place the lens over the opening in
one of the pieces of cardboard and stick the other
piece upon it with glue or seccotine. When dry
fix the lens in its cardboard holder in the front of the
lens hood and repeat the focussing experiment with
the foot rule. We shall now obtain a much greater
magnification with the same length of bellows,
because the additional lens has shortened the focus
of our original lens. Probably our camera is fitted
with a double lens and it is possible to unscrew the
front portion, in this event our extra lens with its
cardboard holder may be fitted inside the front
lens up against the diaphragm and the front lens
replaced. The result is practically the same whatever
the position of the new lens, but we must be
certain that it is convex, for a concave lens would
increase the focal length of the whole and so reduce
our magnification.</p>

<p>We may find that the amount of enlargement
we can now obtain is sufficient for our purpose; if
so we can go ahead and produce photo-micrographs
of all the objects we desire. The methods of doing
so differ in no way from those employed in taking
ordinary photographs and as we are writing about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
microscopy and not photography in these pages,
there is no need to go into further details. Even
the experienced photographer, however, is liable to
overlook one or two important details. The bugbear
in all work of this kind, with low magnifications
as well as high, is vibration. Not only is our
object magnified but every movement is equally
increased. No one should walk across the room
while this work is in progress; in large towns,
trams and heavy motors will ruin many a plate, in
fact it is only when one takes up work of this kind
that one realises that one&#8217;s house is in a perpetual
quiver. Some enthusiasts work at the dead of
night, others suspend their apparatus on springs
and invent all kinds of ingenious devices to overcome
these miniature earthquakes.</p>

<p>If time is no object, we have an easy means of
still further increasing the magnification. To do so
we cut a thin sheet of copper in such a manner
that it just fits our lens tube, in front of the
diaphragm. Then in the very centre of the copper
disc we make a hole with a &#8220;number one&#8221;
needle, the hole is about one twentieth of an inch
in diameter. Replace the convex lens in its cardboard
holder and screw on the front portion of the
camera lens. A trial will show that we have considerably
increased the magnification but decreased
the amount of light admitted by the lens, therefore
we shall probably require an exposure as long
as an hour. How about the bugbear vibration
during such a long exposure is a natural question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to ask. Unless the vibration is continuous, and that
is unlikely, it is less likely to cause trouble during
a very long exposure than during a short one,
because it operates during a small proportion of
the whole time.</p>

<p>All kinds of objects can be depicted with the
apparatus we have described. Minute shells and
insects; parts of larger insects, their legs and wings
for example; the feathers of birds; various rocks,
crystals of all kinds; small flowers and their seeds;
mosses, lichens and many kinds of fungus, in fact
their number is limited only by the degree of ingenuity
possessed by the photographer. Do not
suppose that these low-power photo-micrographs
are interesting only because of their size, the enthusiast
who makes a collection will discover in his
prints hidden beauty of which he had no conception
when he looked at the originals. We have
seen a very large number of low-power photo-micrographs,
taken with very inexpensive apparatus,
showing the wonderful sculpturing on the wing
cases of beetles, some of them are marvels of design,
yet, observed with the naked eye, many of the insects
appear to be devoid of ornamentation.</p>

<p>The production of high-power photo-micrographs
is hardly a subject that can be described in these
pages; the apparatus is costly for, even if one dispenses
with a specially designed micro-photographic
camera, it is necessary to have a good microscope
and bellows camera, for really advanced work.
Messrs Swift &amp; Sons supply an excellent fitting, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
which quite satisfactory photo-micrographs may be
taken. It consists of a light metal cone, the more
pointed end fits over the upper portion of the
microscope tube; the other end of the cone is
provided with ground and plain glass focussing
screens and a dark slide. When using this apparatus,
it is first necessary to find and focus our object
in the ordinary way, before attaching the photographic
apparatus. Having secured our object
exactly as we wish it to be depicted and well in
the centre of the illuminated circle, we remove the
eyepiece and slip the metal camera over the top
of the microscope tube. If now we place the ground
glass screen in position, we can see an image of our
object upon it. Great attention must be paid to
the lighting, it is necessary that the illumination
be perfectly even, otherwise our negative will be
over-exposed in some parts and under-exposed in
others. When everything is in order the plain glass
screen is substituted for the one of ground glass.
On this we shall probably not see any image with
the naked eye, but with the help of a magnifying
glass we can see a much finer image than was possible
on the ground glass screen. The final focussing
is done at this stage and, having secured as
sharp an image as possible, the focussing screen is
removed and the exposure is made. Experience
alone will teach the length of exposure, it depends
upon the amount and nature of the light, upon the
transparency of the object and also upon its colour.
There is no more simple apparatus for taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
moderately high-power photo-micrographs; for
more advanced work the micro-telescope and the
super-microscope (see <a href="#Page_239">Chapter XVII</a>) used with a
camera, will enable the user to obtain pictures of
objects magnified as much as five thousand times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="smallfont">HOW THE GLASS USED IN MICROSCOPES IS MADE</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Having described all the ordinary uses of
the microscope and having also insisted
that the objectives are the most important
part of the instrument, there are probably many of
our readers who may wish to know in what manner
this wonderful glass differs from ordinary glass and
how it is made.</p>

<p>Glass has been defined as a substance which,
during its manufacture, passes from the liquid to
the solid state so rapidly that no crystals are
formed. Usually when solids are melted and then
allowed to cool, they do so with the formation of
crystals, this may be shown in the case of sulphur
by melting a little and then allowing it to cool.
After a while, as cooling takes place a solid crust
will be formed on the surface of the molten sulphur.
If two holes are pierced in the crust and the still
liquid sulphur poured out, it will be found that the
sulphur which adhered to the vessel in which the
melting took place has formed beautiful needle
shaped crystals.</p>

<p>A great amount of original work has been done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
on the subject of glass manufacture and especially
on the kind used for optical instruments&mdash;as a
result there are many kinds of glass differing from
one another in physical properties and in chemical
composition. Although the various chemicals used
and their proportions are fairly well standardised,
as the result of long experience, it is probable that
glass is not a definite chemical compound but a
mixture, in which certain of the components act as
solvents for the rest.</p>

<p>The ordinary glass in use in this country, apart
from specially prepared optical glass, may be either
English flint glass, plate glass or Bohemian glass.
The first named is composed of sand, potassium
carbonate and red lead; plate glass is made of sand
with the carbonates of sodium and calcium, whilst
similar ingredients are used for Bohemian glass
except that carbonate of potassium is substituted
for carbonate of sodium. It is chiefly owing to the
requirements of optical instrument makers that,
new kinds of glass containing very many previously
untried chemicals, have been produced. As a
result glasses are now made with specific gravities
varying from 2.5 to 5.0, that is to say the weight
of a square inch, or a square foot or a square yard
of glass may weigh anything from two and a half
to five times more than a square inch, foot or yard
of water, according to its composition.</p>

<p>Before we describe the details of its manufacture
let us consider its properties as briefly as possible.
At high temperatures it is perfectly fluid and may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
be poured from vessel to vessel as easily as water;
at lower temperatures it is viscous, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, semi-fluid
and can be rolled with an iron roller as dough
is rolled with a rolling pin; it can be moulded
into any desired shape, blown out into flasks
and bottles or drawn out into threads so fine
that they may be woven into a fabric. It is a
bad conductor of heat and for this reason it is safer
to pour very hot liquids into a thin glass vessel than
into a thick one. With thick glass the inner layers
expand with the heat before the outer layers are
even warm and the result is a crack or often absolute
fracture. Sometimes during manufacture
glass vessels which are suddenly cooled will appear
satisfactory, but the particles of glass remain in so
high a state of tension that at the slightest touch
the vessel will break up into thousands of pieces.
On account of this property of glass it must be
cooled very slowly indeed; the process is known
as annealing.</p>

<p>Optical glass unlike most other kinds must be
manufactured in thick blocks&mdash;some of the large
lenses on telescopes are of considerable thickness. All
glass for scientific instruments must also be homogeneous,
which our dictionary tells us means of the
same kind. To be more explicit each particle of
optical glass should be precisely the same in composition
and properties as every other particle.
In the very early days of manufacture it was difficult
to obtain homogeneous pieces of glass and
Guinard, in the 18th century, conceived the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
stirring the molten glass with a rod of fireclay, to
ensure a thorough mixing of the components. This
led to considerable improvement and the method
has survived to the present day.</p>

<p>The first real advance in the manufacture of
optical glass, was due to the ingenuity of two
Germans, Abbe and Schott, who lived at Jena.
Jena glass became famous for the manufacture of
lenses, so much so that a stupid idea still prevails
in many quarters that only the Germans can make
good optical glass. To give them their due it is
good but quite recent events have shown the world
that the Britisher can make better. The two
German scientists used new chemicals in making
their glass and they succeeded in producing a substance
which possessed hitherto unheard of properties.
In what is now known as the older crown
and flint glass the dispersion and refraction increased
with the density, that is to say, the heavier
the glass the more it scatters and bends light rays
passing through it. With the new methods, glass
is made which scatters the light rays very little,
though bending them considerably and vice versa.
The ordinary crown glass is composed of silicates
of calcium and sodium or of calcium and potassium
or a mixture of both and it is possible to make it
colourless and free from defects, but its optical
properties are never so valuable as those of Jena
glass. The most important components of the
newer glass are the oxides of Barium, Magnesium,
Aluminium, Zinc and Boron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Good optical glass should be transparent and
colourless and, as we have stated, it should be
homogeneous&mdash;the refraction and dispersion of light
rays should be identical over all parts of the glass.
It should possess no stri&aelig;, as they are called. Stri&aelig;
may be seen at the edge of a piece of plate glass
as little lines just as though the glass had been
formed in layers. Stri&aelig; detract from the efficiency
of optical glass, nevertheless, some very cheap
lenses are made of plate glass. Bubbles are almost
always present in Jena glass but, unless they are
very numerous they do not appear to render the glass
less efficient. Hardness and chemical stability are
other desirable qualities. Most of these high-grade
glasses are soft, as shown by the ease with which
they may be scratched; many of them are not very
stable chemically and are easily affected by chemical
fumes with the result that their surfaces become
covered with a coloured film. With all their drawbacks,
for optical work the newer glasses far excel
the older.</p>

<p>The manufacture of optical glass is a costly and
lengthy process. The chemicals used in its manufacture
are selected with the greatest care;
impurities must be guarded against for they would
change the composition of the glass and in doing
so alter its physical properties on which everything
depends. The chemical substances are used either
in the form of oxides, nitrates or carbonates, for
the reason that they are easily decomposed by heat.
To assist in the melting of the substances a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
fragments of glass of similar composition are added.
The crucibles, in which the chemical components
are melted, are covered so that no fumes from the
furnace may gain access to them, even the chemical
composition of the crucibles is carefully tested that
no impurities may contaminate the glass. No
crucible is ever used more than once and only
a single crucible is heated in each furnace, in
order that the temperature may be regulated to a
nicety.</p>

<p>The actual manufacture is then begun after all
these preliminaries have been attended to. A clean
dry crucible is heated in a furnace&mdash;not the one in
which the glass making is to take place&mdash;to a dull
red heat. Then, with iron tongs, it is removed to
the previously heated glass making furnace and the
temperature is raised very gradually. The next
stage sees the addition of the well mixed chemicals
to the heated crucible, in small quantities at a time.
When the full quantity has been added the crucible
contains melted glass full of bubbles, some of them
air bubbles released from the raw materials as they
were added and some bubbles of gas given off from
the chemicals as they act upon one another. The
molten glass is then heated strongly so that it will
become perfectly liquid and many of the bubbles
will be driven off. To reach this stage may occupy
anything from thirty-six to sixty hours and
constant attention is necessary during the whole
time.</p>

<p>The next stage is perhaps the most important in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the whole process. After numerous small samples
of the molten glass have been taken, on the end
of iron rods, to see if the air bubbles have been
driven off, the mixture is stirred to render it homogeneous
and to eradicate stri&aelig;. The stirring is
carried out by means of a cylinder of fireclay which
is first of all heated to the temperature of the
molten glass before it is introduced. To the end
of the fireclay cylinder a long, detachable iron
handle is fixed so that the man who undertakes
the stirring may stand at a distance from the hot
furnace. The heat is great and the work of stirring
is laborious and for this reason the stirrers are
constantly changed. The iron handles must be
watched carefully for, owing to the heat they rust
rapidly and should any of the rust fall into the
molten glass it would impart to it a colour and
render it useless for optical purposes. When stirring
begins the glass is liquid as water, but the
stirring is continued during cooling and all the
while the glass is gradually becoming more and more
solid. During the final stages the operation is hard
labour indeed and, finally, it is not possible to stir
any more, then the fireclay cylinder is either
removed or left in the glass.</p>

<p>When the glass has solidified and, whilst it is
still hot the furnace is sealed and allowed to cool
very gradually till it has reached the ordinary
temperature of its surroundings; this may take
several weeks. When quite cool, the crucible is
removed from the furnace and carefully broken;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
then the glass, which may be in one mass weighing
as much as 1000 lbs., is freed from particles of
fireclay and examined for defects.</p>

<p>The next stage consists of moulding and annealing.
Large pieces of glass are heated till they are
just soft, then they are passed into iron or fireclay
moulds designed so that the glass is formed into
discs or slabs suitable for grinding by opticians.
They are allowed to cool very slowly in the moulds.</p>

<p>When the glass is taken from the moulds it is
not yet ready to be made into lenses. It is subjected
to another and very careful examination,
when all defective parts are cut out. Should there
be many defects the glass is again heated, moulded
and annealed. From a crucible containing 1000 lbs.
of molten glass it is unusual to obtain much more
than 200 lbs. of optically perfect glass, it is obvious
therefore that lenses cannot be cheap.</p>

<p>One would naturally imagine that the minute
lenses used in microscope objectives should be
cheaper in comparison than the larger lenses used
for photography or in telescopes, for it is always
more difficult to make minute articles than large
ones. As a matter of fact, even allowing for the
greater amount of material used in the larger lenses,
quality being the same in both cases, they are far
more expensive than the smaller microscope lenses;
the reason being that it is exceedingly difficult to
obtain a perfect specimen of large size. The
difficulty arises not only in the actual manufacture
of the glass but in the subsequent operations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
cutting, grinding and polishing when fractures are
very liable to occur.</p>

<p>From this brief account of the manufacture of
optical glass it is clear that a good lens is always
worth a high price. Its components must be of
the purest quality obtainable, the process of manufacture
requires highly skilled labour and it is
laborious and exacting work. Constant attention
is needed from start to finish and much of the glass
is never sufficiently good to pass the rigorous tests
which it must undergo. Lastly, in the final preparations
of the completed lens, mishaps are frequent.
Added to all these trials of the lens maker
is the one outstanding fact that the process can
never be hurried at any stage, the efficient annealing
of optical glass is one of the most important
stages in its manufacture. A very full account of
the manufacture of optical glass is given in the
<cite>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</cite>, whence much of our
information in this chapter is derived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="smallfont">THE CHOICE AND USE OF APPARATUS AND ACCESSORIES</span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">In this, our concluding chapter, we propose to
give a few hints upon the choice and use of the
microscope and its accessories, to enlighten our
readers concerning stains and staining and to add
such other information as is likely to be useful, information
which is better supplied in a chapter of its
own than scattered about our pages and probably
overlooked.</p>

<p>The most important question concerns the choice
of a microscope. In a book of this nature it is
obviously impossible to recommend the wares of
any one maker. Some firms are celebrated for the
good wearing qualities of their instruments, some
for the delicacy&mdash;not fragility by the way&mdash;of their
fine adjustments and our readers must select their
maker for themselves. One thing we strongly
advise, be patriotic and select a British maker, it
is not only a question of patriotism but of self
interest, for in many respects the British instruments
lead the world. Most of the manufacturers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
advertise in such papers as <cite>Nature</cite>, they all print
excellent catalogues, a perusal of which may be
a useful preliminary.</p>

<p>The instrument we select will depend on the use
to which we intend to put it and on the length
of our purse. Perhaps the question of cost will be
more important to most people. An elaborate
instrument is not a desirable acquisition, till we
are somewhat advanced in our work at anyrate,
and one of the models which most makers call
Students&#8217; Microscopes will do everything we desire.
We should have at least two objectives, three if we
can afford them, a 1 inch and a <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">6</span> inch will enable
us to examine everything described in these pages,
except some of the bacteria. If we wish to add
a third objective we might select a 2 inch one, for
quite low-power work and later we shall probably
become the proud possessors of a <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">12</span> inch objective,
but this would be of little use to us at first.
Two eyepieces will complete our optical equipment.
A condenser for the stage, properly known as a
substage condenser is an addition which we shall
appreciate, though quite interesting work may be
done without it.</p>

<p>Our other apparatus is inexpensive and comprises,
one or two dissecting knives, some needles mounted
in handles, a pair of fine scissors, a pair of small
forceps, a razor, one or two camel hair brushes,
three or four watch glasses, slides and cover slips,
and a pipette or two. A pipette, by the way, is
merely a glass tube pointed at one end and cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
off square at the other; at about its centre it is
much wider than at the top or bottom. It is a
most useful piece of apparatus for picking up small
water animals which we wish to examine. By
putting the pointed end of the pipette just over an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Am&oelig;ba</i>, for example, and sucking gently at the
other end, we shall draw some water and the
animal into the swollen part of the tube. If we
then place one finger over the end of the pipette
to which we have applied suction we can transfer
the contents wherever we wish without it running
out, as soon as we remove our finger the pipette
empties itself. The dissecting knives are useful for
cutting up specimens before examination, the
mounted needles for teasing them, that is to say
tearing them into fine shreds. The brushes we may
use instead of the pipette, for picking up small
objects from water, or when dry. The watch
glasses are useful for examining objects such as
sponges, water fleas, etc., under water. They are
just as satisfactory for most purposes as the specially
constructed zoophyte troughs and, of course,
very much cheaper. The razor is required for section
cutting concerning which we will say a few words.</p>

<p>For section cutting, special razors are sold, they
are heavy as a rule and not hollow ground. Many
microscopists aver that good sections cannot be cut
with a hollow ground razor, we beg to differ, however.
On this point we would advise our readers
to select whichever pattern suits them best; there
is no need to buy an expensive razor, for our early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
efforts, at anyrate, will quickly dull the cutting
edge and there is no advantage in going to much
expense in this direction.</p>

<p>To cut really good sections is not difficult, it is
a question of knack rather than skill; having once
acquired the knack, practice will do the rest. The
great point is to begin properly, some people never
take the necessary trouble in their early days and,
as a consequence, they never learn to cut good
sections.</p>

<p>There is nothing mysterious about the operation,
a section is merely a very thin slice. A good section
for examination under the microscope should, of
course, be so thin that it is transparent; it should
be equally thin everywhere, not thick in some places
and thin in others and it should be cut in the
proper direction. The last statement requires a
little explanation; suppose we wish to make a
section straight across a stem, a transverse section
it would be called, then we must see to it that our
section is cut straight across, and not in such a
manner that the portion from which the section is
cut tapers in the slightest degree. Before we begin
the actual section cutting we must always trim up
our specimen with one of the dissecting knives and
not attempt to make the surface level with the
razor. As a start, let us take some moderately
fleshy plant stem for we shall find it as easy to
cut as anything. Our stem must not be woody,
for till we have had a fair amount of practice we
shall damage our razor on its hard structures; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
must not be too soft or it will be crushed out of all
recognition in our fingers; it should not be hollow,
for solid stems are always easier to cut. Having
selected our stem and the spot upon it at which
we require a section, we cut straight across it at
that spot with our dissecting knife, in such a
manner that the cut edge is as nearly as possible
at right angles to the sides of the stem. A piece
two or three inches long is the most comfortable
to hold.</p>

<p>Holding our razor firmly in the right hand we take
our specimen in the thumb and index finger of the
left hand. Place the side of the stem against the
first joint of the index finger and slightly bend the
tip of the finger round the object. The end of the
stem, from which we propose to cut our section,
should be slightly above the level of the index finger.
With the thumb, the stem is pressed firmly against
the first joint of the index finger and the first joint
of the thumb must not be bent upwards. This
last point is very important, as we shall see in a
moment. From our description the method of
holding the stem may seem somewhat cramped;
it should not be so, however, and an easy position
will help towards success but let it be the correct
position. We may play the violin, in a manner,
without learning the correct method of bowing but
we can never become expert violinists unless we
hold our bow properly, in the same way we can
never cut really fine sections unless we hold our
specimen in the correct way. We now lay our razor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
along the second joint of the index finger in such
a manner that the heel of the razor, or a point near
the heel comes gainst the end of the stem. For the
first time we realize the importance of holding our
specimen correctly, for the index finger forms
a convenient platform on which to steady the razor.
To cut our section, we, of course, press the razor
towards us and, at the same time draw it outwards
from heel to toe. We must never attempt to press
the razor straight through the specimen, however
soft the latter may be, we must always draw the
razor along, at the same time as we press it through
the specimen. Never cut outwards as in sharpening
a pencil and never move the razor backwards and
forwards as though using a saw. The outward cut
will never result in a good section, a sawing movement
will give a section alternately thick and thin.
Should the section be somewhat tough we may find
the razor slip suddenly over its surface, an event
which will impress itself upon us painfully if we
have forgotten the injunction not to bend the
thumb, for the certain result of the slip will be the
loss of a goodly portion of skin upon one&#8217;s joint. A
straight thumb will be out of the danger zone of a
slipping razor.</p>

</div>

<p>Having cut a section it is hardly likely that, at
this our first attempt, it will be good enough to put
under the microscope, so we will continue to cut
section after section till we have a dozen or more
from these we can select the most transparent for
examination. The sections of such material as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stem should be kept moist and to do so we will
place them in a watch glass containing water. It
is often easier, also, to cut our sections if the razor
be moistened with water, at anyrate the moisture
prevents the sections from adhering to the razor.
The sections should be removed from razor to watch
glass and from watch glass to slide, by means of
a brush, never by means of the fingers. The razor
of course, should be well dried with a soft rag before
it is put away; rust, besides being unsightly, ruins
the cutting edge. If we are really anxious to cut
our own sections, and every good microscopist does
so, we shall return to the operation again and again,
even cutting objects which we have no desire to
examine, for the sake of the practice. We shall
soon reach a stage where our razor will be dulled
and require stropping and the efficient stropping of
a razor is, to many people, a more difficult operation
than the cutting of sections.</p>

<p>We may point out here, that all sections are not
quite so easy to cut as the one we have taken as
our example. Some objects are so soft that they
need hardening with chemicals before they can be
cut, some are so hard that to attempt to cut them
would ruin the edge of the razor, though it is
wonderful what hard substances may be cut when
we have had a little experience; some are so delicate
that they must needs be buried in melted wax,
then object and wax are cut together and later the
wax is separated from the section.</p>

<p>Leaves and very small stems may be sectioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
by the beginner, as easily as larger stems. For such
objects little sticks of pith are sold as holders.
Having cut of our piece of leaf from which we wish
to derive a section, we make a slit, with our dissecting
knife, down the middle of one end of a piece of
pith. The piece of leaf is then placed in the slit and
by holding the pith at the sides our piece of leaf
is held firmly. Sections are cut through pith and
leaf, and the two are floated in water, when the
thin slices of pith will float away from the leaf
sections.</p>

<p>Having cut a satisfactory section, let us proceed
to describe the method of making a slide thereof.
We will suppose that we do not wish to make a permanent
preparation but one for temporary use.
A clean slide must be selected, all through our pages
we emphasise the cleanliness of slides, at or near its
centre we put a drop of water and, lifting it with
a brush, we place our section in the drop of water.
If our examination is to be with a low magnification,
we need not use a cover slip, nevertheless it
is worth while to cultivate the habit of using one.
The cover slip is not only a protection for our object
but for our objective. Water you may argue cannot
harm the lenses of the objective. Perhaps not, we
will not argue the point but, when the water dries
on the objective, it leaves a certain amount of
deposit on the glass and this deposit must be rubbed
off. The less often the lenses are rubbed the better
for them, glass especially very highly polished
optical glass, is far more easily scratched than many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
people imagine and a scratched lens is an inefficient
lens. When using high magnifications a cover glass
should always cover our object and the same remark
applies to objects examined in Canada Balsam. This
substance is likely to cause serious trouble if it finds
its way on to an objective. It must be removed,
that is obvious, but it sets hard, it must not be
scraped away for fear of damaging the optical glass
and, as it is used to cement the lenses together,
there is the great danger that any solvent used to
remove the Balsam from the face of the objectives,
may also dissolve their setting. Our digression may
seem somewhat unnecessary, but the very great importance
of keeping all chemicals and even water,
from coming into contact with the lenses of our
instrument cannot be insisted upon too strongly.</p>

<p>In whatever substance we examine our object,
water, glycerine or Balsam, there is a right and a
wrong way of applying the cover slip. It must not
be dropped or laid down flat upon the object, if we
do this we shall certainly imprison a number of air
bubbles and that must be avoided. One edge of
the cover slip must be laid against the edge of the
mountant, as the liquid used for mounting our
object is called, then placing a needle beneath the
cover slip it must be gently lowered into position.
We shall now find that all air bubbles are driven
out as the cover slip is lowered.</p>

<p>When we have cut an exceptionally good section
or when we have some specially interesting object
we may wish to make a permanent slide. The exact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
method of doing so varies somewhat with the
nature of our object and to describe all the methods
of mounting microscopic objects permanently would
require a book in itself. We will suppose that we
wish to make a permanent slide of one of the
sections floating in our watch glass of water. The
first thing we must do is to get rid of the water
with which our section by now is saturated. This
may be accomplished by means of alcohol of various
strengths, which we may put into three watch
glasses. In the first watch glass we have half pure
alcohol and half water; in the second three-quarters
alcohol and one part water; in the third
watch glass pure or absolute alcohol. The section
is transferred on a brush to the first watch glass
and left there for five minutes, then to the second
watch glass for a similar time and finally to the
third watch glass. The mountant may be either
Canada Balsam or glycerine jelly. Should we
decide on Canada Balsam, we put a small drop of
the substance in the centre of a clean slide, place
one section atop of it and then gently lower a cover
slip upon it as already described. Then, without
using any force, the cover slip is pressed down, but
we must not fall into the all too common error of
thinking that a thick section can be made thin by
pressing upon the cover slip. If we have taken the
correct amount of Canada Balsam it will just cover
the area below the cover slip and no more, if we
have used too much, it will flow out on all sides
and perhaps on the top of the cover slip. A very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
little experience will teach how big a drop of Balsam
to use.</p>

<p>Should we decide to use glycerine jelly, we take a
small globule of the jelly on one of our mounted
needles and place it in the centre of a clean slide.
Then we hold the slide a little above a lighted candle,
or even a match will do, to melt the jelly. Directly
it is melted the section is placed upon it, and we
proceed as before. Whichever mountant we have
used, the slides must be put away out of the dust,
and they must be flat and not placed on edge. In
a few days the mountant will set, and we need take
no further precautions with the slides in which
Balsam was used, but those mounted in glycerine
jelly must be ringed, for the reason that glycerine
absorbs moisture from the air and gradually liquifies.</p>

<p>The process of ringing is best performed upon a
turntable, which any dealer in microscope accessories
will supply. It consists of a circular brass plate
which revolves about its centre and to which the
slide to be ringed is affixed. A bottle of ringing
asphalt and a fine paint brush are essentials. With
a little of the asphalt upon our brush, we revolve
the turntable and place the brush against the edge
of the cover slip as it revolves, in such a manner that
we paint a narrow rim of asphalt over the junction
of cover slip and slide. The asphalt prevents moisture
from reaching the glycerine jelly. Of course we
may ring our slides without making use of a turntable,
but it is not easy to paint a neat ring without
mechanical assistance. For square cover slips it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
obvious that a turntable is useless. Specimens
mounted in Canada Balsam do not need ringing, for
the Balsam is unaffected by air or the moisture
therein, when once it has set hard.</p>

<p>Several firms supply prepared microscope slides,
and it is often useful to know where reliable preparations
may be obtained. The slides supplied by Messrs
Flatters &amp; Garnett Ltd., 409 Oxford Road, Manchester,
are models of what well-made slides should
be.</p>

<p>It always lends greater interest to the hobby if
objects are found and mounted by the microscopist
himself. By going out into the fields, by the pond-side,
or along the shore, in search of interesting
material for examination, much will be learned of
animal and plant habits which even the microscope
cannot reveal. Some of us, however, have neither
the opportunity to hunt for our specimens, nor the
time to mount them properly, and those of us who
are so situated will be glad to know where objects
may be obtained.</p>

<p>Apparatus, useful for students of pond or sea-shore
life, may be obtained from Messrs Flatters &amp; Garnett,
who always have a goodly stock of collecting jars,
nets, &amp;c. From the same firm, also, may be obtained
stains and any of the limited number of chemicals
required by the microscopist.</p>

<p>We have given a few simple directions for staining
in our <a href="#Page_152">chapter on Bacteria</a>. In many cases it is
absolutely necessary to have recourse to stains in
order to see the structure of the objects we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
desirous of examining; in other cases it is necessary
to stain when we wish to know the nature of the
various parts of our object. Suppose, for example,
we wish to find out whether a plant section contains
starch, we then add iodine solution, and if any parts
stain deep blue we know at once that starch is
present. There are other stains for other plant and
animal substances; stains for woody matter, stains
for fats, &amp;c., but the art of staining is a science in
itself, and would require many chapters to describe
fully. Most of the objects described in this book
can be studied in the natural state, but, even so, they
may be rendered far more beautiful by staining.</p>

<p>The method we described for the staining of
bacteria does not apply to such objects as plant sections,
&amp;c., and we propose to describe, as briefly as
possible, how to proceed with such objects. Suppose
we are examining one of the common pond plants,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i> for instance, and we wish to see whether
it contains starch. Our specimen is in a slide, in a
drop of water, and covered by a cover slip. In the
first place, we must obtain some fluffless blotting
paper&mdash;the ordinary filter papers sold by all chemists
are excellent&mdash;from it we must cut about half a dozen
pieces, about half an inch by one inch, the exact size
is not important, and they need not be measured.
These we must fold in the centre, so that they can
be made to stand up like an inverted V. From our
bottle of iodine solution we take a drop of the liquid
on the end of a glass rod and place it carefully at
one edge of the cover slip, avoiding allowing any of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the solution to flow on to the upper surface of the
slip. Now, one of the pieces of blotting paper must
be placed upon the opposite side of the slide so that
it will stand up; it must then be moved till it just
touches the edge of the cover slip. The blotting
paper will absorb the water from beneath the cover
slip, and in doing so the iodine solution will be drawn
along to take the place of the water. By proceeding
in this manner and replacing the blotting paper with
a new piece as it becomes moist, also replenishing the
drop of iodine as it is used up, we act upon our object
with a stronger and stronger solution, and, in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spirogyra</i>, the object which we took as our example,
we can see beautiful rosettes of starch grains,
arranged at regular intervals along the green bands
of chlorophyll. This method of staining may be used
in most cases where we merely require a temporary
stain; by reversing the process and drawing water
over the object by means of blotting paper, it may
be used in washing sections and parts of plants. For
very small objects, such as starch grains separated
from the plants in which they are formed, the method
is hardly suitable, for they are liable to be drawn
along in the stream of liquid and lost.</p>

<p>For more permanent staining processes, we must
use our watch glasses, into which we pour the various
liquids necessary for the operation. The precise
methods of staining, the periods during which objects
should remain in the staining solution, and the chemicals
used for removing excessive stain vary, as may
be guessed, according to circumstances. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
chemicals act very quickly, and staining takes place
in a few minutes; others act slowly, and with them
it is necessary to subject our specimens to their action
for hours or even days. Then again, it is obvious
that large specimens take longer to stain than small
ones, hard objects are not so readily acted upon as
soft ones. Experience alone will show what is required
in various cases.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, we desire to stain a section
in Carmalum, a mixture of Carminic Acid 1 grain,
Alum 10 grains, hot distilled water 200 c.c. We take
three watch glasses, in one we place a few drops of
our stain, in another water, and in the third alcohol.
Our section is placed in the watch glass containing
the carmalum and is left there for about two minutes,
then with the help of a small brush it is transferred
for a similar period to the watch glass containing
water, and finally it is placed in the alcohol. From
the last watch glass it may be transferred to glycerine
jelly on a slide and mounted as already described;
Carmalum stains our section a beautiful pink.</p>

<p>There is a temptation to buy a large stock of stains
of all hues and of varied composition. The temptation
should not be allowed to get the better of us.
In our early days at anyrate, we shall do far better
if we use but few stains and learn to understand their
peculiarities.</p>

<p>The most useful selection for the beginner will
comprise Haematoxylin, Safranin, Eosin, Carbol-Fuchsin,
Methylene Blue, and Carmalum. These
should all be obtained ready for use: this will save<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
errors in compounding, and, in certain cases, will
save time; some of the stains, Haematoxylin for
example, are not fit for use till months after they
have been mixed with the other ingredients which
form the complete stain.</p>

<p>Frequently when examining small but lively water
animals we may feel the necessity of some method
of sobering them. All the little organisms, both
plants and animals, which are provided with the
little whip-like structures mentioned so often in our
pages, are difficult to examine whilst they are in
motion. There are many substances, we might add,
which would kill them, but in doing so we shall nearly
always find that they contract to such an extent as
to lose all semblance of their natural shape, and become
useless as objects for our microscope. Should
our inclinations lead us in the direction of much study
of these little beings, we shall do well to keep handy
a small bottle of Rousselet&#8217;s solution; it is composed
of 2 per cent. solution of hydrochlorate of cocaine,
3 parts; Methylated Spirit, 1 part; water, 6 parts.
Any chemist will mix the solution for us. When we
have occasion to examine a too lively specimen, we
simply run a drop of the solution under the cover
slip, as described in our remarks on staining with
iodine, and the creature we are examining will
abandon its frolics and conveniently remain in a fully
expanded state.</p>

<p>Many of our readers will be anxious to carry their
microscopic investigations to a more advanced stage
than we have reached in our pages. Some will have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the advantage of a teacher, and it is a great advantage
to have someone who can show rather than
merely explain what should be done; others not so
well placed may like to know a few really useful
books which will help them in their work. &#8220;The
Microscope and its Revelations,&#8221; by B. H. Dallinger,
is a large and therefore costly work, but it
contains a rare fund of information for the microscopist.
Smaller and eminently suitable for the
general worker is &#8220;Modern Microscopy,&#8221; by Messrs
Cross &amp; Cole. Those who wish to specialize in one
of the sciences, such as Botany, Zoology, or Geology,
will find no lack of books dealing with the subject
that most appeals to them. For photographers who
are also microscopists, we know of no better
books than &#8220;Practical Principles of Plain Photomicrography,&#8221;
by G. West, or the more advanced
&#8220;Handbook of Photomicrography,&#8221; by Messrs Hind
&amp; Randles.</p>

<p>Neither books nor teacher will be able to reveal to
any of us all the secrets of the microscope. By its
means a new world is unfolded before the eyes of
mankind, a world of unlimited possibilities. No man
will ever see all that the microscope can show him,
each day some fresh wonder is looked upon for the
first time.</p>

<p>As a hobby, microscopy can hardly be excelled.
It is a sensible hobby and, after the initial outlay,
need cost us but a few pence each year. We hear
someone say that he prefers an outdoor hobby, but
surely the microscope, if used intelligently, will take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
us out of doors. The search for specimens is one of
the attractions of microscopy. As an instrument for
the serious worker the microscope compares favourably
with any other invention of mankind.</p>

<p>Think for a moment what we owe to the microscope
in a hundred and one walks of life, and then
you will realize the romance attached to the instrument,
and its revelations from the days of Euclid to
the present time.</p>

<div class="centered50">

<p>&#8220;The Headmaster of Eton (Dr. the Hon. E. Lyttelton) advised his hearers, in a recent
speech at the Royal Albert Institute, to read Professor A. J. Church&#8217;s &#8216;Stories from Homer,&#8217;
some of which, he said, he had read to Eton boys after a hard school day, and at an age
when they were not in the least desirous of learning, but were anxious to go to tea. The
stories were so brilliantly told, however, that those young Etonians were entranced by them,
and they actually begged of him to go on, being quite prepared to sacrifice their tea-time.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><em>Each Volume with Illustrations in Colour. 5s. each</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ian Hardy&#8217;s</span> career in H.M. Navy is told in four volumes, which are
described below. Each volume is complete in itself, and no knowledge of
the previous volumes is necessary, but few boys will read one of the series
without wishing to peruse the others.</p>

<p class="adheader-small">IAN HARDY, NAVAL CADET</p>

<p>&#8220;A sound and wholesome story giving a lively picture of a naval cadet&#8217;s life.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Birmingham

<p>&#8220;A very wholesome book for boys, and the lurking danger of Ian&#8217;s ill deeds being imitated
may be regarded as negligible in comparison with the good likely to be done by the example of
his manly, honest nature. Ian was a boy whom his father might occasionally have reason to
whip, but never feel ashamed of.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>United Service Magazine.</cite></p>

<p class="adheader-small">IAN HARDY, MIDSHIPMAN</p>

<p>&#8220;A jolly sequel to his last year&#8217;s book.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Christian World.</cite></p>

British pluck.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Observer.</cite></p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Commander E. Hamilton Currey, R.N., is becoming a serious rival to Kingston
as a writer of sea stories.</em> Just as a former generation revelled in Kingston&#8217;s doings of his
three heroes from their middy days until they became admirals all, so will the present-day boys
read with interest the story of Ian Hardy. Last year we knew him as a cadet; this year we
get <cite>Ian Hardy, Midshipman</cite>. The present instalment of his stirring history is breezily
written.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Yorkshire Observer.</cite></p>

<p class="adheader-small">IAN HARDY, SENIOR MIDSHIPMAN</p>

<p>&#8220;Of those who are now writing stories of the sea, Commander Currey holds perhaps the
leading position. He has a gift of narrative, a keen sense of humour, and above all he writes
from a full stock of knowledge.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p>&#8220;<em>It is no exaggeration to say that Commander Currey bears worthily the mantle of
Kingston and Captain Marryat.</em>&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Manchester Courier.</cite></p>

<p>&#8220;The Ian Hardy Series is just splendid for boys to read, and the best of it is that each book
is complete in itself. But not many boys will read one of the series without being keenly
